      "Darcy and her young daughter Pamela are heading out to the country where her mum's boyfriend Peter left his doctor's position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn. Although this inn has a terrible past and Pamela learns from one the girl's who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house. They called her the 'Tooth Fairy' as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth. This work on the inn, has awoken the 'Tooth Fairy'. Now she has her sights on Pamela and her last baby tooth, but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits Pamela.<br /><br />This flick's old folk myth of the 'Tooth Fairy' doesn't paint her in a very generous way, as you would believe when you were a child. Don't they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares! Another one which did fall into the same category was \"Darkness Falls (2003)\". I can't compare how similar they are in the premises, because I haven't seen the latter, but I mostly read they have basically share the same idea. For a little straight to DVD film, this DTV effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device. Low expectations are needed, as I wouldn't class it as an success, but I found it be to marginally entertaining.<br /><br />Cory Strode and Cookie Rae Brown's story or background for this 'Tooth Fairy' character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural. Silly is a good way to describe what's happening in this poorly scripted story, but it never really feels like a fairytale horror. The dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded. While the acting is simply sub-par with the bland characters they have to work off, but director Chuck Bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts. This kinda makes up for the lack of suspense, the zero scares and generic tone. His direction is reasonably earnest and visually able, where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography. The promising opening scene is creepily effective. His pacing can slow up in parts and there's the odd and unnecessary slow-motion scene put in, but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that I wasn't bored.<br /><br />The make-up special effects provided the goods, as there's enough repulsive gruel and the Tooth Fairy's appearance is especially gooey. The figure of the tooth Fairy can look threatening in its black robe, bubbling make-up and swift movements. Being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness. Child actors can be incredibly annoying, but Nicole Muñoz was decent in her part. Lochlyn Munro and Chandra West are somewhat solid, but can be a little too causal in their performances as Peter and Darcey. The radiantly gorgeous Carrie Anne Fleming is one of their lodgers. P.J Soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn.<br /><br />I thought it was a okay time-waster that has a sound concept, which just isn't fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff. Watchable nonsense, but at the same time extremely forgettable.\n",

The opening is filmed poorly, and like the rest of the movie, it's certainly not scary. In present time, the movie is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe) Peter's renting out his house, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Will Cole survive the wrath of the Tooth Fairy? One of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the Tooth Fairy is. They say she kills you if you lose your tooth, but nope. She's more like a serial killer who kills at random. She steals a bike, so apparently she's a thief too. The movie might have the most laughable climax (Not literally laughable because I found it more sickening than funny) I've ever seen. Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe was in the movie. ary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and they both were in this, so apparently Scary movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies. 80 mins.

      "The plot for 'Darkness Falls' goes something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone. A little too similar to be coincidence. As I watched the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually rose. There seemed to be at least SOME production value. The story didn't seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off. Past the first scene, we get an okay cast of characters. -doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a Busey) and some hot veterinary student (Jenifer from Argento's 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer') After those few minutes, however, the film just slowly goes down the drain. It serves all the basic horrible clichés including: some crazy old person with an unheeded warning, the buff dumb jock, the psychic, and the stripper with the heart-of-gold. Technically, the film is all over the place. The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring. The writing is subpar. When the kid was on screen, it felt like an episode of 'Are You Afraid of the Dark?' . . only less scary. There's some excessive gore at parts (including a fairly cool (yet painfully predictable)) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene. There's a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better films to do that) Other than that, there's not much to bother with when it comes to this film. Final Verdict: 3/10 -AP3-. it out to see the story done in a different way. . . but, that's about the only reason I can find to see this one.\n",

      "Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple, successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world. So, what happens when you've been everywhere and done everything with the formula? You switch it up right? Wrong. The first sign (to me) of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters. There might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think \"Scooby Doo\" you aren't thinking of Film-Flam, Scrappy Doo or Scooby Dum. Even worse, the exclusion of the other core members of \"Mystery Inc\" generally indicate a group of production people who don't like the show. Fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole. Fred represents the Driver, I think in general it is the purpose of Fred to give the group direction, organization. from a kids point of view how the show works. Fred isn't a happy-go-lucky teenager, he's your boss, your teacher, your dad, your authority figure. Shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear. Velma represents rational thought, she applies rational thought to sub-tasks. Left on her own would Velma solve a mystery? The group often finds itself in situations where truths aren't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task. Writers have used Daphne to link unrelated events together through accident. Scooby Doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining. Finally Scooby himself represents us, the participant. He is always in the centre of events, capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of, yet handicapped because he is not human. To me there is a magic with the classic \"Scooby Doo\" formula that should never be messed with. Messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else, something lesser. It falls into the category of programming that can be watched with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal.\n",

      "\"What's New Scooby-Doo\" was pretty bad, since Hanna-Barbera didn't produce it. When I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear, I knew this show was going to be bad, if not worse. I watched a few episodes, and believe me, it is just as bad as I thought. No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool, creepy monsters that rob banks. Now they are going after a typical super-villain whom wants to destroy the world. Scott Menville previously voiced Red Herring on \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" Kasem DOES voice Shaggy's Uncle Albert, which is a sort of good thing. Scooby's Frank Welker voice still hasn't improved. Robi, the robotic butler, is practically worse than Scrappy-Doo. The Hanna-Barbera sound effects are still there. Scooby-Doo hasn't used \"Castle thunder\" sound effects since 1991. However, on one episode, \"Lightning Strikes Twice,\" they use the \"Castel thunder\" thunderclaps during it. , and it wasn't enough, unfortunately.) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it, then they might be better than this crappy cartoon. To get my mind off of this poor show, I rented \"Scooby-Doo, Pirates Ahoy!\" which came out around the same time. And you know what? The \"Pirates Ahoy\" movie was actually BETTER than \"Shaggy and Scooby-doo Get a Clue\" What's New, Scooby-Doo!\") And it looks like the new designs that the characters have isn't permanent to the franchise. The direct-to-video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs, thankfully. The Scooby-Doo character is the inspiration for the popular children's book series Scooby Doo. The book is based on the popular comic book series of the same name. Scooby is the son of the character from the same book.\n",

If you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you'll be very disappointed. Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment. The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements. The movie misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations. The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene. Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search. It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators. If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily easily crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted. He was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate. 'Five Days' is a very weak British crime story.\n",

Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - who wouldn't, right?!... But, when her dad gets ratted out, and then killed (I hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you'd have to be brain-dead and blind not to see this coming in the film)  leaves her behind to save his dad, never mind her loss, and says (paraphrasing) \"If god wills it, we'll meet again\"... Basically meaning, \"I'm gonna get my dad and MY job done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye!\" - callus beyond even low-life Hollywood standards. Pass - really, complete and total waste of time. A great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but NOT worth watching just for this. In fact, Veer-Zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 I'd say!\n",

      "The first half hour or so of this movie I liked. The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them. Once the action switched to the home of Ingrid's fiancé, it all fell apart. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME. The movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate (just as in the other film). I was not a huge fan of THE RULE'S GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film.\n",

The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including shabby larger-than-life special effects. It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula.

Robert De Niro plays a racist zealot who runs a deep-sea diver training program that is run by a racist Zealot. The girls -- one could hardly call them women -- are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. Other decent performers -- Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook -- have even more perfunctory roles. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. People address each other by rank -- \"Lieutenant\", \"Boatswain's Mate,\" \"Commander,\" as they do in the Army. In the Navy they are simple \"Mister\" (if an officer) or addressed by their last name (if enlisted) . Everyone in the Navy, it seems, hates Negroes except for one guy from Wisconsin. Gooding is an enlisted man, a second class petty officer. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school. These kinds of flicks were common enough in World War II. Cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner. Here, the technical details are skipped over. I couldn't follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn't exist. The direction is no help either. The movie abounds in close ups, so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had. And the emergencies are confusing because they're ill focused. Thoroughly formulaic, and not well done. except maybe \"G. I. Jane\", in which the abused hero is a heroin. Or try \"From Here to Eternity,\" in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend.\n",

Problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. The characters are little more than walking cliches of the usual suspects. atch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) the supporting cast is flat-out obnoxious. The awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dreary and cheap. This thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon. Positives: Quite possibly the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time.Negatives: The visuals, pace, and sheer lack of originality. forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderous.\n",

      "If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film, its theme was (literally) drowned out by the emphasis on \"special effects\" over characterization. Almost as if in an attempt to \"keep up\" with the rest of the summer action blockbusters, Disney has ditched the character-driven, movie-with-a-message approach in favor of a Star Wars \"shoot-'em-up\" The days of beautiful, handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly-line CGI. At times the film comes close to being a good, worthwhile movie, but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful. The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story-tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island/continent. Nothing is hypothesized, even from a purely fantasy-based point of view. The viewer will leave the theatre asking. The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable. From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914. There is nothing left to think about or mill over except the loss of money in their wallets. Most of the jokes are gross one-liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons: They are delivered at lightning-speed pacing and usually mumbled. The way these supporting players do a moral turn-around near the end of the movie is hard to believe. This is the first Disney not to have cute, talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition. Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes. In the first five minutes of the expedition, approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought. Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Disney needs to get back to their roots. A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be. There's more to \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" than the film's plot. The film is based on the book of the same name. The book was published by Simon & Schuster in 2007.\n",

      "Some have praised _Atlantis:_The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I don't think so--at least not for thinking adults. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at times. Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox, has any depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. The story about how one companion, Vinny played by Don Novello, went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing. While the characters were thin at best, the best part about _Atlantis_ was the voice talent. Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner. I'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory. The plot was the worst. The character animation has not been this bad for Disney since the minimalism that drove Don Bluth out the door. Aside from landscapes, buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress. neyed or trite. I'm not so sure about that. Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. Writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as \"Ireland\" and completely ignore the older, Latin term Hibernia. But more than this, they need toknow of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the icier island Greenland. 2. The Shepard's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying \"in the King's eye\" It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology. Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. Since noone left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface. This would have made more sense. Milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life--appeared in dreams, etc. This needed to be explored in the movie. Current Atlantians were alive before the cat. No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to converse in Europe. The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels. Kashakim's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence. Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in. A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim's likeness, when Kida tried joining her father's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis. Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal. 8. The crew's \"double-cross\" was not a character change. Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Unless the word \"crystal\" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning. However, the \"change of heart\" falls flat. Hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with. Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling in the rest of the area. With it's powersource restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. The technology is superior to ours, and definitely to early 20th-century. In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness. But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes. And pulp stories is part of the \"crap they can't sell adults anymore\", anyway. 4 out of 10--the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot, it seeps ever lower. 4 out of 5--the film is enjoyable, but the plot is a let down. 4.5 out of 6 -- the film is good but not great.\n",

Killed a bunch in the cataclysm, stalled progress (not a lot killed here, but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody. If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke about it, it still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from Milo's reading it as part of the book. Ripping out the page--which was dog-eared in Rourke's hand, even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently--only was there to tip off the viewer that \"something was not quite quite quite right\" \". Unless the word \"crystal\" would have set alarms off in Milo's head that somebody would try to steal it, Milo would have suspected nothing. It's just thick-headed foreshadowing\". The crew's \"double-cross\" was not a character change. The ending STINKS and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness. With it's powersource restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing coddling. The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might. . In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet, chastened culture alone, not to send it into hyperdrive. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. The movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot, it seeps ever lower. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well.

But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grich. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period. All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. Boris Karloff's version is one of the most popular Christmas carols. The film was shot in the 1950s and 1960s. It was directed by Boris Karloff and starred in the cast of The Godfather. It is still played every Christmas.\n",

      "Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966. When he died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the film rights. The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects. Unfortunately, it is undermined by the rather hazy cinematography. This film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience at the age of eight. \"The Grinch\" is 105 minutes long, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and a thug. The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whovilles of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies. This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic. The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos. Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their stockings than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. She seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations. Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!\n",

      "Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one. This is 2 hours you can never, ever get back.\n",

      "Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault. Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. The whole movie rings false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch was such a jerk. Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor. George W. Bush is from rational, lucid thought. Thumbs down to this big fat turkey.

      "If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction. Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. However, I will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the development, the story-telling, and the acting. Unfortunately that is where the film's positive elements end; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen. inch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who's from their Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, the later playing Lou Lou. The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou. The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape. There is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. The movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack, and the ample makeup department. The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative. The dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about. His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself. He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical. Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from Jim Carrey. 's zany silliness. It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part. This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic.\n",

      "Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident. This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Dr. Seuss' story. The end result is a movie that lurches and never never stops. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones' animated version.\n",

      "For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion. A man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalking by a cop from hell. Then when a major Hollywood company produces a big budget FX laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon.  NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point. What struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks. Everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors. Unfortunately the budget should have been upped to include better actors. Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film. NotT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996.\n",

      "If you rent a movie titled \"Exterminators of the year 3000,\" the odds are good you know what you're getting yourself into. Let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensue--at least, such were my hopes for this \"film\" Exterminators of the Year 3000 is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at movie-making I have ever seen. The dialogue, the acting, the cinematography, the sound-editing, the editing in general, the plot, etc., etc. etc--all are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations. Exterminators of the Year 3000 also has a fair supply of \"dialogue-so-bad-it-becomes-funny\" provided in great part by Crazy Bull, the aptly titled leader of the hapless motor-psycho gang. A quality kill, for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase, isn't a hard and fast term, but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome, creative, or ridiculous fashion. Crazy Bull is all you could ask for in a b-movie motor-psycho. Shakespearean paraphrase and oddly PG-style insults are all he knows how to say...and that's terrific. Exterminators of the Year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects, quality killing, and bad dialogue. 40 minutes is simply not enough to justify a full feature length, owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car \"chases\" and long desert hiking sequences. All in all, a pretty good awful movie, but hey, it's no Death Race 2000.\n",

      "J. Lee Thompson made some excellent films, notably 'Ice Cold in Alex' and 'Cape Fear' 'Country Dance' is one of his more curious offerings. The story is set among the upper classes of rural Scotland. Peter O'Toole was, when he was at his best as in 'Lawrence of Arabia', one of Britain's leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven. He overacts frantically, making Charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat. Throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are rather better, but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. The main problem with the film is neither the acting nor the plot, but rather that of the Theme That Dare Not Speak Its Name. Even in the swinging sixties and early seventies there was a limit to what the British Board of Film Censors was willing to allow. A film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits. These hints are therefore never developed. We never get to see what motivates Charles or what has caused his moral collapse. The film is a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 4/10 for a film that doesn't tell the whole story.\n",

It takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you're watching. The characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable. The story feels totally disorientated. Basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. The movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer. The editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences. J.

      "Gods...where to start. I was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before I turned it off in disgust. Aside from the actor playing Robin Hood himself, the rest were just terrible. And, I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far. The soldiers, on horseback, were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 feet. As he's running away, he goes from having them 10 feet behind him, to a shot where you cannot even see them at all. Then, he runs into some bushes, and is immediately manhandled by two of the soldiers...who just mere seconds before, were galloping on Horseback, dozens of feet behind. Robin manages to fire about 5, perfectly aimed shots all around one soldier's hand, in the span of about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a recurve bow. No human alive could make those kinds of shots, in that short amount of time, with a scoped rifle, much less a bow. The lead soldier's \"armour\" is about 5 sizes too big for the poor fellow. How this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me. The production costs (at least for what I saw) must have soared in the dozens of dollars (or Euros) This was so bad, even that terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was better. , and go rent or buy the mid-80's \"Robin of Sherwood\" series.

      "Well, it's Robin Hood as 'geezer' all right... just as advertised! That didn't sound very hopeful, and alas, it was worse than I'd suspected. A laddish Robin I can take; a Robin who tangles with a pert dyer's daughter I can credit. A Robin who exchanges not-very-funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow. Much sounds as if he's struggling with half-comprehended Shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip. I hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast. If they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies, the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines. The lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered (and in this case written) with a nudge and a wink at the audience. They're out of place all right -- fourth-wall-busting stuff -- but really not that funny. promised production reminded me of a limping school play. The only actor and character I felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing Guy of Gisbourne. As of the time of writing, I'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit. The opening episode of \"Doctor Who\" wasn't exactly a show-stopper, though it was nowhere near as bad as this. But if I see no improvement after episode 2, I'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer.\n",

      "this film tries to be immensely clever, and Tarantino-like. before you try that though, you need solid filmic fundamentals. these include good sound, editing, set design etc... i have never been more distracted by a sound track, ever. the sound in this movie is plain bad. the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout. i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie, which are the result of poor sound editing. the sound inside cars is awful, the sound of car doors closing is awful. the spaces are wrong. everything about it is wrong. Every trick in the book is used, and yet the foundations are just not there. at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever. we hear sound when we're not supposed to. sound edits precede visual cuts. How can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise? Chile's cinematic new wave? the best creative output that Chile has to offer? i hope not, and i think not. film is crap. The film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino, new wave inspired porno! The film is rubbish. it's all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating.\n",

      "\"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True\" is one of the worst movies ever made. It was created around the same time as \"The Little Mermaid II,\" \"The Jungle Book II,\" and \"Peter Pan II\" All of which were disservices to their original film classics. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing. Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: Did the people at Disney watch the original \"Cinderella\" when making this sequel? \"There was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie,\" says critic. \"I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney's name\"\n",

I personally think the antics of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming merits of this movie. ette is the best, about Cinderella getting used to being to being a princess. The worst of the vignettes, when Jaq turns into a human, is cute at times, but has a lack of imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also cute. The incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however I hated the songs, they were really uninspired, and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original. Cinderella while still caring, had lost her sincerity, and a lot of her charm from the original, though she does wear some very pretty clothes. A cute, if unoriginal sequel, that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story. 4/10 for the mice, the voice acting, the animation and some pretty dresses.\n",

It seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don't)Sing-a-longs to the characterization. While I remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn't seem to fit. It's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit. The movie itself could have been it's own story, I think that it should have been just that. artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original.

There's no question WI's politics are conservative. The film Cusack co- wrote, produced and stars in, fits worse than a cheap suit. tailored to appeal to my demographic, but the problem is, the tailoring is substandard. Unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as M*A*H. The current state of US politics, foreign policy and the war \"effort\" is already absurd. You can't write material as funny as what the Bush administration provides us on a daily basis, so why try to compete? None of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, the Neo-Cons and the US occupation of Iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny. The writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive. The trouble is...it isn't.  WI would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed research/insights into the Occupation. As it is, the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness. The bottom line: hyperbole isn't required when it comes to lampooning US/Neo-Conservative politics...it's already a big enough joke. War, Inc. proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny.\n",

The lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances. The dance numbers seemed anemic as well. The choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin performers out there, wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of Rosie? Jason Alexander's effort was astounding, he always does intelligent work, but he just wasn't Albert. The 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively, while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers.

Whereas the Italian translation makes Ben's plan something deeply human, characterized by human sympathy. The film is aimed at \"donating\" parts of his body, but lacking any authentic human empathy. At least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie. The only exception is the love-story with the girl, which seems to be a sort of sort of love story. -programmed incident, to which Ben yields, but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement. I really didn't like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person, however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused, takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide. I would have liked, and I think it would have been more positive if, in the end, Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living. He wouldn't have saved their lives miraculously, of course: this would have probably caused more suffering, but I think it could have been more constructive from a human, and moral point of view. more, just standing near them, and helping them through his presence. , feeling, as it should be, destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body, doesn't seem to feel so much tried, both emotionally and physically, from his impaired condition?

Sure, he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way. But to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly. The second problem I have is the idea of drugging brides. Why brides? Wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do? Watching Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, I was reminded of the idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. In each case, there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective. The movie is called The Case of the Missing Brides.

It's revealed that she is 70-80 years old yet Lugosi looks to be in his mid 50's. Lugosi's experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab. Then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies,maybe the neck,and then the needle is rammed into the body of Lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie. A weird old hag and her two deformed sons....one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides. The other son is an mean little dwarf....little person to be politically correct in today's world. Who these 3 are and how they came to be Lugosi's scared assistants is,like a lot of stuff in this film, never explained. So anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to. .This expert turns out to be creepy Dr.Lorenz..She quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors..I'm not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty work. And then later it's revealed that the young ladies don't even have to be brides for the procedure to work. This clunker reminded me a lot of another Lugosi stinker,\"The Devil Bat\" Same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly 'reporter gets bad guy' deal. But Lugosi is always good--he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested. Lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog. He must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through. He gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera. the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him. We horror fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi.\n",

They are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans. Lugosi is a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides. They never really explained WHY it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had. A reporter wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were STOLEN. She follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of Lugosi. Lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people. Eventually, the maniacs ALL die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well. A reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry. The reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs. There's a lot of fainting in this film. Or, maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!\n",

      "Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist. Cinema was one of his biggest passions (he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time. But the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews. \"un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence\" is as underwhelming as its predecessors. Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way. The starting idea let predict a twirling, spiritual comedy. The plot follows a well-worn pattern with characters who have specific well-known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. Even the actors' sincere input in the venture is debatable. , especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor. It's regrettable to say it: Bernard Rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as \"un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence\" bears witness.\n",

Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that's all the more annoying for talking nonsense, it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama. Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Granted, Appollo 11 wasn't safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure. The overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive. 's why they let people and press watch in almost-real-time. The capsule ejection wouldn't work. Like it didn't work the time a chimp was in it. The one that survived? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. 5) The technology then was primitive compared to today's standards. What's with the fact that they were using \"TV screens\" rather than \"computer screens\"? if not, I'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong. 's the same damn technology. Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition. If a thing is flying and you don't know what it is, it's by definition an Unidentified Flying Object.

Neil Armstrong's near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate; I hadn't seen it before. , \"fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module\" \"Catastrophic chain of events\" usually results in catastrophe. There's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid. lessly like a gleeful kid. Hilarious stuff. There was never a shuttle lost in space itself, while the voice-over presents this \"fact\" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap. toff and re-entry, respectively. In any case, comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, okay, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that, the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience. Movie is somewhat obscure. Catch-phrases like \"covered up until now\", \"publically revealed here for the first time\", come up. Film doesn't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything. In summary, in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate, it's not even good entertainment.

This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Rest. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. Overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking. I doubt I'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci-Fi channel.

Sure, there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out. After a successful run in the eighties and eighties, director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay. The majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one-note. A few of the actors were good enough to save the film. Uma Thurman was great as G-Girl. Luke Wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting. Anna Faris was just doing her \"Scary Movie\" routine and it's getting a little old. Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me.

Uma Thurman is tops, as usual, and Luke Wilson pulls off his role too, though his slacker antics quickly grow tired. What's even more maddening is that, in certain scenes, you sense a witty, raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out. The world is in a state of emergency in the U.S. after the midterm elections.

      "I have to admit when I went to see this movie, I didn't really have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally and utterly disappointed...Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends. There's slight mention of a girl stalking him. Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from \"hot\". Normally I'm all for his acting, but even he couldn't salvage this movie. His character was jumpy, unrealistic and rather annoying. The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny, but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman's \"passion\" let's say. Luke Wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber. Overall I would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid $8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. The script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors, and their dying careers. Overall, if you value your money, and your self respect do NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.\n",

Before seeing it I had a fairly good idea that it wouldn't be genius - the premise seemed far too silly and stupid. \"I was shocked at how terrible the script was. It really gave the actors NOTHING to work with, so much so that they really looked like they didn't know what they were doing (especially Luke Wilson) The story was completely predictable - if you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about\" The direction seemed to be of realism. I got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all. There were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire. \"I wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made, and still pull a large audience...\" I couldn't think of any other reason why this film would be made. \"I found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes\" By the end, and exceedingly, dumb-founding-Ly stupid climax, I was laughing heartily - just not at what the film-makers wanted me to laugh at, but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was. Thank God I didn't have to pay money to see it...because that would have really annoyed me!!! Oh, and could I just add, that of the two Wilson brothers, I have always preferred Luke because I think he is a good guy. , more versatile actor...but if he wants to step even further into OWEN's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it...I doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours!!! and remember, it only got a generous 1/10 because I couldn't select 0!\n",

      "\"The Groove Tube\" is one of the most unfunny, unclever and downright horrible films ever made. To put this movie on the same level of entertainment as \"Plan 9\" or \"Robot Monster\" would be a crime to those films. This film is SO bad, SO poorly made, acted and scripted and SO incredible stale, that there just isn't even a trace of \"camp\" or \"schlock\" to be found. Just to keep the men viewers from leaving, Shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often, but poorly-filmed breasts from 1974. Even though this was made before Saturday Night Live premiered, comparisons were probably inevitable. 't going to excite anyone these days. Truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep-inducing excursion, I doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either. The \"jokes\" and \"gags\" are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dad's porno mags out at night won't laugh. The \"dancing man\" sequence, where a guy (Shapiro) on the streets of NYC dances to a tune, is easily the best thing in this horrible film. The part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film. The name of this film should have been \"Ken Shapiro's Craparama\" It's amazing that this was made, but many truly talented filmmakers can't get in. However, I bet the geniuses at NYU would love this movie. Total garbage.\n",

      "In Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase \"nonfiction novel\" to describe the book on which this film is based. The spirit of that form was carried over into the film script, which he co-wrote. The confinement of shooting a film for TV makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film so claustrophobic. The directing doesn't get in the way. It's just that the movie doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument. It doesn't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward Smith and Hickock. At the end of the TV version, we are left with the feeling: \"Ho hum, who cares?\" I actually only gave this a 4 because I save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs--the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an hour with Capote. It will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material, and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie.\n",

Someone with a problematic right hip,limited mobility from a stroke, is now able to walk. Someone paralyzed on the right side, particularly(God doesn't know?) a burning in the legs, who has just been healed. 8. A man with a plate in his skull is having a continual problems, and the doctors just don't know what to do. Terry said she saw the bone reforming around the plate(The funny bone?!)and the mans pain is gone,he was now healed. There's a man with a financial need- I think a hundred thousand dollars. Within three days,the money will be supplied through the miraculous power of the holy spirit. There is a woman in Cincinnati with cancer of the lymph nodes. The lord is dissolving that cancer right now. When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer did he go to Peter Popoff?, Oral Roberts?,Benny Hinn?,Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17,2003 Pat went to a REAL DOCTOR to have his surgery! (You mean to tell us that he didn't go to a doctor?)4. There is a lady in Saskatoon in a wheelchair-curvature of the spine, The lord is straightening that our right now, and you can stand up and walk! Just claim it and it's yours. Thank you Jesus! Amen, Amen! When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean war He was a liquor officer, responsible for keeping the officers supplied with liquor. He was known to drink himself and frequent prostitutes and he feared he contacted gonorrhea. His daddy Absalom Willis Robertson (D Va) was Chairman of the Senate Military Appropriations Committee. Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister on Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and his evil vengeful god reminds me like Venger on Dungeons And Dragons. We have imagined ourselves invulnerable and been consumed by the pursuit of health, wealth, material pleasures and sexuality. It (terrorism) is happening because god is lifting his protection from us. The September 5 2005 edition of The 700 Club included a report Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lane from outside New Orleans Convention Center which has housed mostly impoverished black disaster victims throughout the weekend. A number of possessions left behind suggest the mindset of some of the evacuees. If any of you good people ever think of donating to these sexist bigoted people please in the name of God don't! Sponsor a softball or basketball team,give to a food shelf, be a big brother or sister to a child but please don't give to these people because they have been around for over 40 years and solved nothing. If you still don't believe me type Pat Robertson overheard during commercial break on the web and hit search and once you hear what hes really like, I know for sure that you will not give one cent to these conning liars! And by the way Terry once had a divorce and Pat has talked against divorce many times on his shows. Pat,Gordon and Terry can go someplace else and take their angry god Venger with them! I do! By the way folks if your sick, go to a real doctor and lets everybody laugh at these liars.\n",

      "\"The 700 Club\" has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself. Headed by Pat Robertson, the unscrupulous, megalomaniacal founder and leader of the Christian Coalition. , Jews, Hindus, non-Fundamentalist Christians, Democrats, single mothers, foreigners, feminists, evolutionists, environmentalists, NASA scientists, and anyone else who doesn't share their fanatical religious views. It's actually the best fake news since \"The Daily Show\" or the \"Weekend Update\" segment of \"Saturday Night Live\" The Religious Wrong stick their noses in everything they can and ask for one donation after another to fund Pat's African diamond mines. Never mind that Pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of Zaire and Zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth. It's all for the greater glory of God, don't you know? \"Viewers\" supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts (they claim to have \"words of knowledge\" come to them) but who NEVER APPEAR on the program to say what happened to them. Honestly, how can anyone take a show seriously when they're using a poor applause recording? It should make people wonder why there's no studio audience. 't WANT to realize are the horrible things he's done and said. This is a guy who agreed with Jerry Falwell that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States were the result of God punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism. Pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon. Pat Robertson has called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. He also supported forced abortions in China. Very \"Christian\" of him, wouldn't you say? \"As the Bible says, be fruitful and multiply, so congratulations, Pat\" Robertson says Christians today are \"being treated exactly as the Jews were in Nazi Germany\" To compare his \"plight\" to the horrors of the Holocaust is almost unforgivable. Robertson is one of the biggest liars in history. \"The 700 Club\" is evil masquerading as good; it's a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing. It's living proof that hateful, dangerous religious views aren't confined to certain groups in the Middle East. Even those who are not of the Christian faith know that it goes against everything Jesus taught. If he were to become President, he'd be the harbinger of Armageddon - and not on the side of the good guys. Instead, He'd be chastising them as He did the Pharisees of His time and overturning the money bins.\n",

      "Leonie Haddad, a lady whose husband had recently died, agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. The lodger had, in fact, come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. HaddAd soon realised that something was 'rotten in Denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting a poem. Haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife. She managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. It was a miracle she survived. The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy. Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity. The Notorious Bettie Page is a legendary cheesecake and bondage model who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography. Gretchen Mol plays the 'Queen of the Curve's', the 'Tennessee Tease' and 'Miss Pin Up Girl of the World' Day-glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950's. Page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies. Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God. Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages and personal tragedy. Her 'mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories. When the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past. She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her 'glory years' 'The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious' 'It was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light'\n",

Bettie Page, supposedly, was the \"pin-up queen of the 1950's,\" the ass millions of men ejaculated to. Her history as an American sex bomb is familiar: Southern, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this movie she is a naïf, an innocent unaware of the prurient interests she serves and shamelessly profits from. Although she believes in Jesus, she enjoys f f f. icking nude before a camera lens -- just the wholesome girl-next-door sex-slave American males supposedly fantasize. Writer-director Mary Harron herself, Oxford-educated AND ex-punker: \"I feel that without feminism, I wouldn't be doing this\" Ms. Page has a boyfriend, but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship. In New York, where Ms. Page tries her best to fit into and appease a man's world, the movie is smug. Like hell Harron doesn't \"make feminist films,\" says the director. Ideology has become so internalized, so assumed, so programmed, that it's almost invisible. Big Brother must be smiling.\n",

      "Sadly, Marry Harron decided to do a fictional account of Bettie Page's life to go along with her own issues with men. As typical in all her work, every major male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling, or twisted. To add to her fiction, she projects ideas and issues that are not true. , her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks. The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Bettie's own words. The director's attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie.

      "Bettie Page was highly in demand in the post-world war II period as the queen of \"naughty\" pictures. Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life. The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet. When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A- rather than an A one can only assume that there were more A-s out there. The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms. Page's \"naughty\" photos seem in 2007. I'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds. I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments.\n",

So intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth. as, but Harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character. In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse, domestic violence and a gang rape, but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again. You get the impression that Harron and Guinevere Turner (co-writer) wanted to gloss over anything that wasn't glamorous and flattering. The film really frustrates you as you watch, desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself. It seems to me that Harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today's standards. Page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions. This woman was a central part of a Senate hearing on Juvenile Delinquency, but no one is ever really shown as shocked. I left this film just thinking how tame it was. the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous. They come across as two lifelong fans of Miss Page and are desperate to make sure that nothing, absolutely nothing, could possibly put a bad light on their heroine. They have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was. to a viewer.\n",

The constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings. Melvyn spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie,played by Faye Wray. Lionel Atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes. Atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get. Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing. Bela Lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch. Think of this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was. The high point of the movie is watching Frye,he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie didn't offer much. If you can't make a good 1930's horror film at least put Lugosi in it, at least make it with him in it. He was the star of the film's most famous villain, The Count of Monte Carlo.\n",

      "The Vampire Bat is set in the small German village of Klineschloss where Gustave Schoen (Lionel Belmore) the Burgermeister is holding a meeting with Inspector Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas) from the local constabulary. Six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood & bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks. The Vampire Bat was a cheapie from Majestic Pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars Atwill & Wray. The latest victim Martha Mueller (Rita Carlyle) has been found. telling tales of seeing a large Bat. Brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders. The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr. takes itself rather seriously. The film focuses on Brettschneider & his incompetent investigations which are boring. There is no Vampire Bat, the attempts to fool you are pathetic, all the character's are broad stereotypes & you can tell the villain of the piece straight away. I know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933. A bland, flat, dull, boring & misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just doesn't cut it these days. Director Strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it's age. There isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House (1932) & Universal's European set on their back-lot. Technically The Vampire Bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern, for the age of it it's alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong. Speaking of King Kong it's star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill, I'll be kind & say the acting is OK. \"I must admit I'm not a fan. bore. It's short & it tells it's story reasonably enough but I must admit that I am not a fans bore bore,\" says reviewer.\n",

      "The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century, where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism. There is a very similar feel to James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's Dr Niemann character. This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred. Like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief. There is a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. , 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative. All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation. The vampire elements are purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans.\n",

      "In my opinion, this movie shows just how depraved man can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about this whole Springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the \"Jerry Springer Show\" act as they do (which in itself is eminently reproachable), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives. The movie has an R rating, and while it may deserve only that, I feel that an NC-17 might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content. If not glorifying that kind of behavior (as some might say) at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and/or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior. The plot is very bizarre, tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset. At the end, the movie leaves one with some resolvement- and Springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world. Springer's show is sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic. Let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic titallition that Springer seeks to give us. or the news to see that.\n",

      "I can't quite say that \"Jerry Springer:Ringmaster\" is the worst film I have ever seen. The film would be better off if it were. It is an endless repetition of poor people screwing each other, hitting each other and insulting each other. The plot covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill. This makes it impossible to care what happens to them. It never mattered to me whether they got on the show, or what they said. Scatology is not wit. Humor has to have something behind it, some kind of painful irony or life experience in order to function. Jerry Springer's pose as a populist tires me. Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows, his movie, his book and videos. His guests just get round trip air fare, hotel accommodations, and a chance to humiliate themselves. If he liked poor people so much, he'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him. The film is weak and boring. It doesn't even succeed at being offensive. If you want to have a better evening, videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that. appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself.\n",

      "I think that, deep down in the darkest, slimiest part of their heart, everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit. While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid, it gives us a chance to see that, relatively speaking, most of us have it real good. Jerry is performing a public service, and we should be grateful. \"Ringmaster\" follows the pre-requisite Springer story line: Love triangles. One triangle involves Connie, her daughter Angel, and her husband Rusty. The other involves Starletta, Vonda, and Demond. When the two hapless groups meet up in LA, their lives intertwine. \"Ringmaster\" is true to the show, as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. The movie has a problem. It's billed as a comedy, but it just isn't very funny. What laughs there are to be had are few and far between. The Jerry Springer Show just isn't meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen. What's funny in an hour long show isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a story is threadbare. The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself. He's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly. Watching Ringmaster: is so bad, it even screws up the best part of the Springer show: the Final Thought. Not that I'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. Just the opposite. They all suck. It's like he was going for a 'What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer' vibe, and he failed. Miserably. A woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program. It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts. What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn. umps of goo? I say no. Somewhere out there, in this crazy, mixed up world, there is a perfect movie for each of us. We just have to keep looking for it.\n",

      "The final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record. Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for \"musical concepts\" and her wardrobe. Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance. Streisand plays Esther Hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom. Kristofferson's John Norman Howard is a hard rocker heading for Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story, \"Norman Maine\" sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer \"Vicky Lester\" achieve her success. Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. Streisand, on the other hand, makes the leading lady tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit. Streisand exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. The filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim. They don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism. The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary. The fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie. Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be, a vanity project. The film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes. But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand wanted it to not be.\n",

      "The \"saucy\" misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s. There's a Swedish girl, a Danish, a German and a Chinese. The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them, involve them in some Carry On-type humour. Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential; the girls are stereotypes, and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder. The most interesting section is the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing. These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we've ended up with. The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer. The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations. The end is striking, as Mayne's sheik for no earthly reason whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade. Director Val Guest directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest, which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks.\n",

Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of \"posh totty\" to have been committed to celluloid. As a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made. The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling. None of it is left to the imagination here.\n",

      "Originally, SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July of 1999, a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the time.  SNITCH never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG's notorious Experimental Feature contract. After all, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI... I too believed the myth back then. Let's just chalk it up as \"film school\" for many involved, myself included. D was shot over two weeks in August, 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA. Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes, he is a Drama and English teacher...) hence the locations and cast. SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. None of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself. One year later, Eva, now on a soap, and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, SPLIT SECOND. Since Cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it's cover. 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ, Mexico. I though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control. The film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez. Despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue. On the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN. the same Subject, VirGin of JUarez and Border TOWN, the same.\n",

After that he turned to the mainstream, beginning with the diabolical 'Lord of the Rings' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight Frank Frazetta for 'Fire and Ice' 'Fire and Ice' is just designed for 14 year old boys, and has the intellectual clout of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. In my view though, this was just another blip in the slide in quality after 'Wizards' from which Bakshi never recovered. 4.5 out of 10.5 of a possible 10. 5 out of ten. 4 out of 5 of 10 of a potential 10. 4 of 10 out of 8 out of 9.\n",

The movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. From a half hour into the movie, not one scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era. The music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the movie. A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere. It is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim. The film falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film. I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s or 90s. Cheers! The film was released in 1987.\n",

      "To say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects. This is 2005, it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background. Anything that involves a half-man, half-hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation. In 2005 it just looks low budget. Spare me the cheap attempt at Sci-Fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief. As sad as it may sound, this is probably worth your time. If nothing else, it is a tour de force of bad Sci- Fi. The crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind, but also the ability of \"B\" movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines. This film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions - bad guys always wear sunglasses. One of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the Charlton Heston lookalike, \"wait for Tom\" The thing is, Tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never-ending banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, in layman's terms. \"My goal is to evolve the human species\" -. the mad scientist says near the end of the film. The faint Freudian references uttered by the mad. scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about.\n",

      "this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist. bill forsythe .. well, i'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film. he's way too good for this kinda stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. . It ain't Shakespeare folks. Other than the plot, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, the cinematography also left many things to be desired. There were shots were they were trying to look \"cool\", but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy. The movie is based on a novel by the same name. The book was published in 2007. The movie was released in 2008. It is currently in its second week of cinemas. The film is rated PG-13.\n",

      "Hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist. The movie is set on an uncharted island. The island is used as a location in a number of movies. There are at least 50 uncharted islands in the world. The island used to belong to Dr. Moreau, but has recently been purchased by the Re-Animator himself, Jeffrey Combs. Old Jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research, which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer. If that sounds familiar, that's because this is roughly the same basic set-up as the smart shark facility in Deep Blue Sea. William Forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments. In typical Bond Villain fashion, the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his chum. . Not chums, like buddies... chum, like shark food. So enter shark-boy who starts stalking the Skipper and his cohorts all over the island. They, of course, make half-hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again. The only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it's over. That's pretty much how this movie is. The only reason you should watch this film is because you want to stop. with a hammer.\n",

      "\"Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy\" is a SyFy Original Movie. The movie is about a half-man, half-hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island. The film is based on the popular TV show \"Dinoshark\" The movie misses the mark...not by much, but enough to make me not recommend it. Its titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a backseat to a bunch of faux-military thugs. Though the hammerhead does rack up the body count, he (or it or whatever you call it) isn't the movie's primary villain. The rest of the movie is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. That, to me, is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people!

Hunter Tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend, William Forsythe, isn't about to give her up without a fight. )at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments. This island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and \"son\" They think it's a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases. Tylo was dating Combs' son.  Hammerhead:Shark Frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks(..where the shark rips apart limbs) Combs traps them in a conference room, but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son. The attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which, truth be told, is rather infuriating. The monster itself is never seen in it's entirety, just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror. One thing's for certain, you do see teeth. Combs doesn't break new ground as the scientist, but he's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold-blooded resolve. It's fun seeing Forsythe in a rare clean-cut hero role, very against type as against type. Forythe is an electronics wiz who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril. Tylo is also in a very different kind of role, a scientist who can defend herself quite well. Roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep, and it's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun. I mean, seriously, would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do? Beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop. who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins.\n",

The being is in fact his son, who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer. The shark-man is amazing and saves the day. He even get's the girl. to be a resourceful, if somewhat overweight, Ramboesque hero. I'm working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support.  Hammerhead is a lame creation but OK, I guess, judging by the effects in general in this film. There are guns, gore, girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter.

      "The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement. This might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be. For a guy in a big rubber suit in an action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit from some mystery. . Granted, it is usually shaky and erratic. I guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out. The writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten. The people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset. Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, WHATEVER, they all explode. So much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end. The bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest. It might be a good one to MST3K with your friends, but past that, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, do yourself a favor and change the channel.\n",

      "The Brain (or head) that Wouldn't Die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. The dialog is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is merely OK (but not consistent). Why have I given this film a 4? Because some thought clearly went into it. I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror. The story of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high quality, body onto her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably non-plussed by all of this.

      "Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the most lackluster onscreen car crash ever. Leith is decapitated and the doctor takes her severed noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates the head in his lab. The ending, in uncut prints, features some ahead-of-its-time splatter and dismemberment. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of Ever's misfires, a mutant chained in the closet. Some of the library music later turned up in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH.  1959 should have been declared The Year Of The Turkey. It took years to be released and then, audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved. Between this, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a few others, 1959 should've been declared 'The Year of The Turkey'\n",

He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. At the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet.

      "Ann Nelson plays the grandma here. Three years after this, she would star in \"Airplane!\" as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get that image out of my head. Boston's mom and Grandpa bought an RV, cheap, and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert California. The RV soon has a mind of its own, going off the road and such. The elderly couple are appropriately afraid, but stay in the vehicle in order to move the plot along. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes, and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother semi-flip out, but her mental breakdown occurs offscreen. Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own tale. He thinks mom is wigging out (this was made in 1977) The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert. American mummies sort of fly through the air. One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield, and Matt begins acting all crazy. This is a pretty creepy little scene that is eventually overplayed. As scenes dragged on, it was obvious Flocker was padding. Cut the fat here, and this would have clocked in at at least two hours. The scenes where the RV runs off the highway, then back on again, take forever. The final \"explanation,\" that the mummies' spirits were trying to kill those close to Matt never holds water. The film maker never brings up that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways, they never kill anybody! This is unrated, and contains some physical violence and mild profanity. This is not scary, and like the ghosts, you too can still walk...away from this tape at the video store.\n",

      "The choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced I was watching something recent. Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak, but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet. The Muppets Take Manhattan (henceforth: TMTM) is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper. The music is far less satisfying, the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible. There are, of course, some redeeming and genuinely funny moments, but they are few and far between. The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits, so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest. Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper, the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business. Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison. These two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films. , the music sucks. The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM, to put it nicely, makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated. Grodin's big solo during The Great Muppet Caper, while not having the same resonation, he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own. TMTM feels severely time-compressed, with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion. TMTM does have its guest stars, but they are either poorly utilised (Brooke Shields and John Landis) or totally out of their element. To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery. The characters are poorly written at best, with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard. Animal shouts singular words at times, but they have nothing to do with the plot. owwy\" after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets. Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet. Swedish Chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn. The script is one of the most essential pieces of a film. The production is also substantially improved. Had the story and script been better thought-out, TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper. . As it stands now, it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence, or excrete. Without him, this film would be unwatchable.\n",

      "If this documentary had not been made by the famous French director, Louis Malle, I probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes. This is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies. Considering I didn't know any of these people, it was even less interesting. The small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed. When the film makers returned six years later, the mood was depressed. Several ugly ideas such as blaming Jews for financial conspiracies, anti-Black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored. The 1979 portion was almost 90% of the film and the final 10% only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne. What about the rest of the folks of this town? Did they all see Reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative? While many in the media demonized Reagan (a popular sport in the 80s), the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one-sided and agenda driven. Had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and hadn't seemed too negative to be believed. Overall, not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be--ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985. By the way, does the film DROP DEAD GORGEOUS seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by this film? Both are set in similar communities, but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones.\n",

      "This does not even rate trash. This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer. To call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere. This luvahire character claims this movie is great. One has to question his grasp on reality. \"The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job\" \"It's not easy to be emotional in a scene\" \"Ricky did an outstanding job\" Luvahire: \"I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off\" Luvahire may want to look into another line of work if he thinks these chuckleheads pulled it off. I am too disgusted to continue. I shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate, Mr. Bangla. Whether you want to comment on the movie or not, you can do so by leaving the comment alone. The other negative comments here at IMDb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie. Few people will rent a movie titled \"Hood of the Living Dead\" if they require these elements to be top-notch. The acting, the soundtrack, the directing, the dialogue, the editing, etc. can readily be forgiven, in and of themselves. \"Hood of the Living Dead\" practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one-liners and gruesomely creative kills. Here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto. \"Hood\" fails to deliver on the abundant promise of its name. The movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing, but don't understand. the two genres could have been hilarious. To avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video-rental audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers re-release the movie with the following new title. \"Hood of the Living Dead: A home-made horror video\" \"The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting.\"--Mr. Bangla. \"A. low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio\"\n",

Neither hip- hop music nor hip-hops culture had much of a role in the movie. -hop artists there, so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack. Any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick. Why the Quiroz Brothers didn't take advantage of this is beyond me. The rapid-fire use of the word \"fuck\" is probably this movie's most distinguishing characteristics. dropping an F-bomb in every line in the movie. There were single lines that contained the word three or four times. The characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else.

      "A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie. I decided I would do something I had never done before. Review the same movie again. that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells, in animals) and his brother Germaine, the two aren't exactly on the best of terms. One day Germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting, and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine. naturally the serum fails and Germaine \"dies\" (if that didn't happen there'd have been no movie) The story (in my opinion at least) meanders and is rather slow moving (pun not intended) Germaine returns to life to attack and kill the paramedics. I would talk more about the plot, but I feel that if I reveal more you wouldn't want to watch it. Don't like the fact that the director(s) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move. They couldn't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble. In one scene the zombie runs in one scene. Sometimes they just don't seem believable (yes I know their fictitious creatures but still), I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room. I still don't like the zombie who is lying on the ground, gets shot, then jerks like he was just shot. The sound in the movie also bothered me, mainly the music, which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent. The movie is still bad, almost House of the Dead bad, it's better, no doubt about that, but then again that's not saying much. The acting is still atrocious (in my opinion) and is on par with the American \"actors\" from the Japanese zombie movie Junk. the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick. This is the type of movie I think is well-suited to be premiered on the Sci-Fi network. Despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes (and yes, I still don't like the opening song)\n",

Desperate, Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health. The formula hasn't been tested on a human, or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil, the acting is just horrible especially with Rick' s fake crying for his brother. The guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out, and the make up is just lame. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest.

Very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN which ruins the movie. About one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist. Despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth. s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn't help the movie at all. One can't help feeling Roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen\n",

      "I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. Gus Van Sant took a straight man to make a funny film. Nothing against the man, but -- however Gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to makes a funny movie. than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. His clout allowed him to hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster) caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. The cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was fairly funny. Casting him as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong,wrong. John Hurt as \"THE COUNTESS\" is a gay friendly man. But he is a SERIOUS, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR!!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp, for this. . For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad. Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More, and sadly shake his head. No talent, no training, no problem. Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. In the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. \"God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits\" Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? Uma doesn't pull it off, probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma plays it more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia.\n",

I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk.

It ranks as one of the worst major films of all time, preposterous and inexcusable on every level. It tries to be clever, but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic.

      "The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious, but I will recap them here in case anyone cares. The first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with Freddy. Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer is HEREDITARY. Why not a mystery-type slasher in which Lisa Zane's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? The town has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner. The essential problem with this plot element is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. Of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct. How are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast, well, I think their performances here speak for themselves. . Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B-films. FD is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.\n",

      "WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS. A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. Just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it. The premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out \"we know this is garbage, but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?\" If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony. When Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels. Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin, a potentially fatal sound. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with \"shut the f**k up, man\" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest.\n",

This isn't just the worst entry in the \"Elm Street\" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre!

      "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare starts as dream demon Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) leaves a teenager (Shon Greenblatt) on the outskirt's of Springwood with no memory of himself. The local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane) interviews him. She finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to Elm Street in Springwood where they discover that no children live there.  directed by Rachel Talalay this was made with the intention of being the final A Nightmare on Elm Street film. by this time had reached five, of course as any horror film fan know's if there's still money to be made from a franchise or a character. The film moves at a reasonable pace & it's rarely boring but it's so silly, childish & feels like some sort of live-action cartoon with some awful set-piece horror scenes. The sequence where stoner Spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by Freddy is terrible on it. \"You can't take this seriously & I was just sitting there not quite believing what I was seeing,\" said the reviewer. The most ridiculous thing I've seen in a while, or maybe the early scenes when the John Doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground like the Coyote cartoon character in the Road Runner cartoons. The film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark, scary & sinister yet it's so silly & simply looks ridiculous. When they do finally try to kill Freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon, yeah that's right a pair of cardboard 3-D glasses! The character's are poor, the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing, it doesn't really stick to the Elm Street continuity. There's not much gore in this one, there's some cut off fingers, some stabbings, someone falls on a bed of nails & that's about it. The body count is extremely low here with only three death's. The final twenty or so minutes of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare was in fact shot in 3-D although the version I saw presented this part as normal. The acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including Tom Arnold & Roseanne. special effects vary, some are quite good actually while other's are terrible. Freddy's burnt make-up this time looks quite poor. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series. Fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from Wes Craven's original classic shocker as it gets.\n",

      "Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood. Now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**SPOILER**) needs a family member in order to do it. In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story, it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before. The finale is OK but doesn't provide as many sparks as I think one might hope. Film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits. Johnny Depp cameo acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.\n",

I would call it funnily crap. If Freddy had a daughter, wouldn't that information have surfaced like in the first one!? The ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy, exactly like the rest of it.

There certainly weren't any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources. I was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. There was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable. The English subtitling was below par and contained many errors which, at times, completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The movie does fall short in a few places though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things. The scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash. Overall, it's a cynical, pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that! Actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key.

Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through. The film had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on Get Smart. that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. The film was released on September 14, 2014.\n",

If there is a love story here, it is lost in the malaise. Rock Hudson is nobly wooden. This is Lauren Bacall's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances. Robert Keith, as the loving, out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult children, is the most sympathetic character. chman in countless Westerns, but here he is an honest, likable fellow. I take my social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a few likable characters, thank you.\n",

Everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries' borders. \"Any Way The Wind Blows\" is by no means a bad film, but it's definitely overrated. This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as \"Short Cuts\" and \"Magnolia\" The only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists is the city of Antwerp. The main problem with \"Any Way The Wind Blows\", at least according to yours truly, lies with the characters. They really are random, uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary. ious\" one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes. The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp. Some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles, but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable. \"Any Way The Wind Blows\" is a competently made and stylish effort, but too mundane and slightly boring. I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it weren't a Flemish production.\n",

      "Tom Barman, director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the better known rock bands of the late 90's here in Belgium. For those not in the knowing (mostly the non-Belgians), Tom Barman is the director of the film. The post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album \"The Ideal Crash\" in 1999, presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting.  dEUS at it's best made fun and provoking music, but never anything close to what I would consider *art*. It shows. Basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people, doing equally uninteresting things. The characters are shallow, the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings. The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh (not quite loud) Don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous. Except for the few smiles, it bored me out of my shorts. The soundtrack is pretty good, though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST's have shown lately. The movie makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs. Camera work is poor and the soundtrack is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack. All in all, it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies. The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor. Since I originate from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of \"guess-the-location\" game. I keep on noticing that lately, the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country. Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too. tell it in a way that is both sharp and emotional (the brothers Daerden come to mind). Maybe the Flemmish Art-house Films should try it too.\n",

You had a story of an inner city family's struggling to make it the best way they knew how. Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way. The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit. Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family. Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. I guess James's paycheck didn't do much for the family. They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving. James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others weren't realistic at all and that's a shame. Michael's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan's show. I mean really, here was a guy that was failing in school, he kept getting laid off, and he painted for money in about two episodes. what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs. The show stopped teaching us about growing, building and learning and instead taught us about gimmicks and catch phrases. They should have kept James. If any show needed a father it was that one.\n",

      "Lot of silly plot holes in the film. First we see him watching his master practice kung-fu, and die in the midst of his practice. Is that even possible? I don't think so. This show is purely for Jay Chou fans, and the film lacks a depth. The two actors looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm. Not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all. The 4 masters of Jay Chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court, degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala Royal Rumble style. When the 4 masters won the fight, the crowd began cheering, and the match continued. It was truly a WTF? moment. In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual \"chick flick\"). Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of IMDb's top 250 films of all time, then this film is not for you.\n",

As to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes. Jay Chow himself DO NOT know Kung Fu, it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can. Luckily the movie do not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects. Despite how hard I wish to stop anyone from watching this, it has became one of the best budget films in China for this year. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.\n",

Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator. Borges is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film. and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument).\n",

      "Cyber Tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie. New conspiracy is in the works, one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes. There is no plot to back any of this up. Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. There are so many steals from better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III!) that it's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material. There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact.  Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man. With no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material.\n",

Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth are beyond anything television has ever seen. The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study. The 700 Club is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to The 700 Club's vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country. In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks. But in today's world where where many people belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them, such action is no longer an option. The television ratings system and the \"V\" chip on TV's should also have a rating called \"R\" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by The 700 Club.\n",

Keaton gives a credible performance all the same.

      "Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the studio had \"jumped the shark\", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime. Archibald Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever. Although he's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip. Again and again, his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks p p p. Moto is now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was. In a great twist, several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other. Overall, the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that Moto is still a buffoon. The Moto series should have ended here. With WWII approaching, the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway. Having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the US or in allied countries.\n",

      "WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was headlined by an Elimination Chamber match. Only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York with the WWE Championship. Those men were current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event. Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber. It was then announced that Edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match. The undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away. Any pay-per-view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success. The women of the WWE also had a busy night. There was the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which was won by Ashley and the Woman's Championship was also on the line. Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. , Ric Flair. This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish.

      "There's a \"hey kids, let's put on a show air\" about this telemovie. Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances. Co-writer, co-producer Tom Fontana and his pals pack the goings-on. There was always a tug-of-war pitting quality-conscious executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious NBC execs. \"Nash Bridges\" regularly beat \"Homicide\" in the ratings. The movie was written by Fontana, co-writers Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac. They took the most ludicrous story are from the series, topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line, and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members. Yaphet Kotto as Lt. Al Giardello is now a Kurt Schmoke-like candidate for mayor. The spotlight shifts to Giancarlo Esposito as Gee's son Mike. But the question for viewers always was: is Mike that uncomfortable as his father's son? An apparent snuff streaming video was promoted, and then seemed to actually take place, on the Internet. After some red herrings, the detectives arrested a repellent suspect. But Zaljko Ivanek's harassed and overworked Deputy States Attorney forgot to file motions. The mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Maryland Legislature, the U.S. Attorney General, NBC, Court TV, the BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano and Le Figaro. Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally underused. Time wasted on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials. The writers do seem to satirize this, presenting Jason Priestley as the latest big big guy. There's some other sly casting, with actual Lt. Gary D'Addario playing another detective. Guests drop in from other shows, like Whitney Allen doing her deadpan and clueless \"Miss Sally\" Dina Napoli of WBAL TV turns up as herself. Ed Begley Jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance. The movie was made when Court TV bought re-run rights to the series. That network contributed legal waif Helen Lucaitis, who later appeared on \"Oz\" Although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, Lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with Esposito. Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome a loser script. It's fun to watch top pros do their stuff; it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance. Die-hard fans may want to see this movie anyway, but you can live without it.\n",

This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling, limbs severed, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action, and won a great following without having to resort to effects.\n",

This might very well be the first movie I ever watched on the pay channel \"The Movie Channel\" \"The Van\" was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time. I remember watching this movie back then, and thinking it was a typical teen flick. I totally forgot that this movie even existed until I recently seen this movie again after having not seen it for decades. ) I recognized it, and bought it for a mere $4.99. It was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music, smoking weed, and having sex in the back a fancy van. This is what a good teen party movie should be. izes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend. blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out Dodge Van. He eventually gets to have sex with her. But his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him. The two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans. The movie does have it's funny moments. But watching this movie 30+ years later, it becomes more of a trip down memory lane. half/ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier/better off and the movie ends. The one thing that is depicted in this movie that I honestly can not remember is ....I never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being. I remember young men in the 70's (self included) wanting a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or Pontiac Camaro. I also remember many of the songs in this move(when they were new)......this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards. This movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one. This just wasn't true of that era. hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van.\n",

The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. 's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion. The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. oppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect.

If you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. I showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like \"what the hell is this piece of crap franco?\" The movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. And in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work. But unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small Scale company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!) Once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. Heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed. This movie is basically a movie for kids. But this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn't a problem. If you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like I do) well Id suggest you steer clear away from this one. Gordons a great director, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Well, at least not now that I'm a full grown adult.\n",

The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows. There are as I recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices.

      "1976 musical melodrama also takes the rise of the Supremes as its inspiration. Written by Joel Schumacher well before he became a big-league director of mainstream studio product. Released five years before the Broadway opening of \"Dreamgirls\" True to form, however, Schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichés and eye-rolling one-liners. Sam O'Steen, a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director, helms the production like a low-budget TV-movie with a frustratingly episodic structure. First as a sweater-wearing quintet called the Hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as Sister and the Sisters. But naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group. Sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer Satin Struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie. Levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick-up for Satin. Stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some Jewish mobsters for financial help. Delores just gets plain fed up. Solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances. R&B great Curtis Mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs. Lonette McKee's valiant attempt to make Sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham-fisted plot turns. The best work comes from Mary Alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre-\"Fame\" Irene Cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role. The DVD just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice-over by DJ Casey Kasem. \"Dreamgirls\" is a film lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as \"Dreamgirls\". The film is based on the novel of the same name by Virginia Magnay. The film was released in the U.S. on November 14, 2013.\n",

      "Maiden Voyage is a film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. A film that is more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage. The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category. Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship hijacked by a gang of evil criminals. Of course, there is an all American hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day. The film's dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean.Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. \"I threw the. bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results\"\n",

      "Casper Van Dien is a character played by Casper van Dien, who works for a security agency that thoroughly test safety procedures for companies and individuals. It's one of those movies which uses the \"Die Hard\" formula of a tough but troubled guy being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You can see this movie as a sort of mix of \"Die Hard\" and \"Air Force One\" and the movie doesn't even try to conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source of 'inspiration' It uses all of the clichés out of the book. The movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully. I mean, hijacking an huge cruise ship with only about 8 guys, of which halve only carry some small guns and then ask for a ransom of 'only' 10 million dollars is itself already quite ridicules. How do they even intend to split that money afterward? Every person gets just over a million or something? That's hardly profitable for such a big cruise ship. The Van Dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa. No matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship, they always bump into each other instantly. And then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage. You never see more than like 30 hostages however. Of course the movie also doesn't feature the best actors, though I must say that Casper Van Dien really isn't a bad 'action hero' and actor. lazy writing within the movie. Halve of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some ridicules slow-motion. Van Dien once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really doesn't help his career much. All of the other actors also do a fair enough job but their characters are just so formulaic that they never truly become interesting. It's not the most original or memorable film you. have ever seen but it also ain't exactly the mostOriginal or memorable one either. 4.4/10. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis.\n",

At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they're clearly watching the clock here. 's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras.

      "McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten. Avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film, the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico. Gary Busey goes through the motions with his cardboard character. Henry Silva has presence as a screen villain, but he's totally miscast here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) and the awful script gives him a bad name. Some really clunky lines of dull dialogue make his performance come off as laughably wooden. After a dull first half without much exciting action, things do pick up a bit at the end. But it's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun.\n",

Major O'Rourke (Jones) & McBains's ex-wife. For an action movie with depraved sex, there's a dearth of action and not much sex. The running joke is that McBain gets shot all the time & survives, keeping the bullets as souvenirs. Apparently the writers didn't see \"The Magnificent Seven\" The production values are poor, with distant shots during dialog and very little movement. The main prop, the tank, is silly enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who might have been a blonde Julia Roberts, has to go from simpering to frightened to butt-kicking. \"Bulletproof\" is still noisy enough to play when you leave your house but want people to think there's someone home.

Like many others on here, I don't know how to categorize this film, it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror. People who liked this film used words, like \"ambiguity\" and \"ambiguous\" This movie actually started off well with the family \"meeting\" the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the film), nothing happened. Like the Blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. It didn't. The world is in a state of emergency in the U.S. after the midterm elections.

      "The opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes. The snow drenched scenery is gorgeous, yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery. Some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional, the dialogue however is clunky and artificial. . The action is slow and underwhelming, the overall feeling being one of someone trickling cold water over your head, but so slowly that you barely notice. The way in which the husband, wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic. The themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before. The family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film, Fessenden playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time. The 'stalker' figure Otis has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped. The film fails in respect of whichever genre you wished to pigeonhole it in. People can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies. You can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but I think people would be better off over analysing. \"I would rather see them on the carpet for some deep emotional meaning, rather than these vacuous sub-human creations,\" he said. \"I would like to see people using. their carpet for something more than just a carpet,\" he added.\n",

      "The Shape of Things to Come is a film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own novel by the same name. The film was directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director. The film opens in 1940 in a London-like \"Everytown\". War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them. Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath.  Structurally, the film is far too episodic, with little to dramatically tie it together. By the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. There's a constant parade of new characters. . We don't get to learn anything about any of them. The individual segments, with a couple exceptions, tend to be awkwardly directed and edited. They are also occasionally manipulative--it can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score. The common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is \"a film about ideas\". That may be true, but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way. The Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. Wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film. One pilot has shot the other down, but is now coming to assist him. But the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas. The bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war is enough to build a film on. During the scenes featuring the would-be warlord, in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is a nasty contagious disease called the \"wandering sickness\" The usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease. This material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought. Wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for its own film. The production and set designs are interesting, even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of George Méliès' 1902 A Trip to the Moon. Just don't expect too much from Things to Come.\n",

      "I saw this movie during a Tolkien-themed Interim class during my sophomore year of college. I was seated unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for instance, the Black Riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in Bakshi's film. This movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I've decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological fashion- If I've left out anything, please let me know. *Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' during the film, without explanation. He wears purple and red for some mysterious reason.*Sam is flat out flat out wrong. . The portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying. Yes, hobbits are small like children, but they are NOT children. Merry and Pippin are never introduced--they simply appear during a scene change. Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants), complete with huge, square pilgrim belt buckle. He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie. The Black Riders appear more like lepers than menacing instruments of evil. The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen goes on forever, during which time the Riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and... do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbs to his wound. Boromir appears to have pilfered Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from that Bugs Bunny opera episode. The Balrog is howl inducing and the least-threatening villain in the entire film. The battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters display any level of competency with their armaments. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's film, but they ARE supposed to be fighting. Some of the voice acting is pretty good. It isn't that Aragorn SOUNDS bad, he just looks kind of like the Jolly Green Giant. Galadriel is somewhat interesting in this portrayal; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the Ring's powers of temptation. *As my professor pointed out (between whispered threats), the orcs resemble the war-ravaged corpses of soldiers, a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted. Bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie, or so I've been told--the project was on a tight budget, and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher higher producers. ups (who I'm sure hadn't read the books). I respect Bakshi for even attempting something of this magnitude. I simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product. I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy. You can learn as much from this video as you can from it. Watch it again and again to see if you can get any more out of it. It's a great way to learn more about the world.\n",

Therefore, not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy, the film itself seems less than finished. The whole thing seems shabbily made and undone, especially the Orcs and the Nazgul. Bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie, and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours. Far too many important bits were left out. The characters... well, most of them were okay. The hobbits don't look so bad (except for the gay Sam) Did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make Sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character? If you're a Tolkien fanatic (like me), watch this movie. If you didn't read the book or didn't like it much, or don't like animation films, you probably don't want to see a half-hour LOTR. But know in advance that you're not going to watch a real 'Lord Of The Rings Movie' but not much more than a historical curiosity. A. movie... stay away. A. movie ... stay away from this movie.

      "Watching this again recently, I found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen, even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure. By any objective measure this was a disaster, but I foundIt easy to imagination how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, that will not be possible for a long time. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did it, although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution. Fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film. Another thing I really appreciated in this version - the silent moments. Jackson and co hit this with more than US$270 million dollars in production costs, at least $90 million dollars more for marketing, a massive tax break from the NZ government, and also gained massive savings from filming in NZ not the USA. However, despite the marketing claims, the intention was the intention. Jackson said they originally intended to make a fantasy film \"along the lines of\" the lord of the rings, and that the one he really wanted to do was Return of the King. Philippa Boyens said they deliberately didn't re-read the books before writing the script. This was not a good film, but the potential was there. was too fast. Naturally they cut a lot, and adapted other scenes. Jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose. Bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway.

      "I watched Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings when I was half way through reading the Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. When I did finish the trilogy I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid idea because it wasabsolutely rubbish. I was acturly bored 20 20 years later. None of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page. Even my favourite character who is Gandalf did not seem interesting at all. The animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks (they looked awful) and Aragorn and Sam face. I don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better. I just hope that nobody judges the books by this film.\n",

      "The premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting. But this is the only interesting part which was also dealt 20 years ago with quite finesse by director Ravi Tandon in his film \"Jawab'( 1985) too. sensitive director going for half-baked characterization of both of his protagonists-Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film is getting over, audience didn't know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with. This factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration. The revelation of Don's son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax. Note of self-realization and regret by the Don about what went wrong with his own family. The whole dramatization of life of an Underworld Don, operating from abroad looks quite illogical. itching a mediocre, newcomer actor like Aryeman opposite Mr. Bachchan is again not a good idea. But nonetheless film has some plus points. Ashok Mehta's fine camera-work, two good fight sequences (co-ordinator Abbas Ali Moughal) and some light well-acted scenes of Akshay Kumar.\n",

Amitabh tries to give the role his all, he does his part well, though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling the trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar His dubbing too isn't matched properly at times. Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood's family. The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization. ay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams.Aryeman seems expressionless, tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes.Bhumika emerges the best of the lot.\n",

      "In 'Intensive Care' he's quite likable, but he seems to be uncomfortable with the flick in which he is participating. No one can blame him. Whether he should have made the attempt or not cannot be judged. IC. deserves its ranking in Verheyen's Hall of Fame by all means & standards. The story of the Murderous Maniac Who is Supposed To Have Died In An Accident But Is Alive And Wrathful has been told dozens of times before. IC contents itself with a hospital wing and a couple of middle class houses. The sex scene is gratuitous but not in the least appealing. The couple from Amsterdamned could have made it work, though. While dealing with the couple subject : the whole subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work. Hence, in a slasher, the cavalry only comes in time to need rescue itself. The (anti-) hero has to take out the villain, mostly through clever thinking. Translated to the events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves the dame. Intensive Care is a bad movie, which can only be described as bad. Intensive Care was released on September 14, 2013. Int intensive care is a movie about a doctor who tries to kill a killer. Intintensive Care is about 80 minutes long. Bad Taste lovers can verify Verheyen's catchy statements and make some up for themselves. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is endure a horrible monologue by a fellow doctor/French actor and look horrified. Koen Wauters learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. He could have played his Naked Gun part again, to end up as beef, but with a longer screen time. I had never seen a maniac being brought down by launching fireworks into his guts in order to crush him against a flexible fence. It is good for a laugh. Race he has to abort before coming to his senses. Race he must abort before he can come to terms with what has happened to him. Race that he must aborted before he could think about what had happened. race that he can't think about until he has come to senses.\n",

      "John Ford's \"The Informer\" is an overwrought and dated piece of silliness. Ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. There is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution) The acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films. What dialogue there is usually has a \"They're always after me Lucky Charms!\" quality. The movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. As bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in Ireland. The sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.) Ford's comments were \"fair warning\" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career. Ford's remarks were more just \" fair warning\" than anything else.\n",

      "Russian fantasy \"actioner\" (and I use the term loosely) that I've been trying to watch for over a year. I've finally gotten to the end and now I wish I didn't put in the repeated effort. Very little is said. no explanation is really given for anything (like why they lock id girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part is all off screen. It looks good, is well acted and had there been some form of reason for what is going on it might have been a good film. The movie runs the better part of two hours and it feels like its six. I would have liked some sense of real character development or back story. If they weren't going to tell us anything they could have at least picked up the pace. 4 out of 10. Its about four hours (all my attempts to see this) I'll never get back. Only for those who want to see a brooding Russian action film with very little action.\n",

Der Todesking follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week. How anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me. The director may have been making a point about death, but only he knows what it is. Each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story - but it doesn't! We just get a quick little sketch on suicide, and it only makes you wonder what the point is. The film feels like it should be deep, but there's a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it. Der Todesking is the only other film I've seen from this amateur director. I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2, and now I'm really in no rush to watch either. this film just isn't that memorable. \"It's a film with no point and anyone that calls it 'art' is very much mistaken.

      "I can't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and I feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs. When one of the main characters announces that he's gay twice in the first five minutes, don't ignore it as typical PC nonsense. If his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn't make you sick, then be thankful the freak who wrote and/or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint. I mean, get real. The film is supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of \"closure\" over the sudden death of her daughter. What does one thing have to do with the other, one might be tempted to ask? The two issues are inextricably interwoven. \"This grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go,\" says critic. \"Would YOU slurp up some ice cream she just served you? I think not. It must be a New Jersey thing,\" he adds. \"It's not about death, a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter, or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up\" \"It's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director\"\n",

I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled. Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and...that's it. As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a token and is very badly written. Eva Longoria's role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar. A truly shameless marketing ploy.

Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) Troubles arise as we see Pete's close involvement with the First lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself. When Pete fails a polygraph test, he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge. But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent, how can he prove it? The one, big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. The audience is never let in on why the assassin(s) want to kill the Prez. Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere? 'S WAY)?

You may get more enjoyment that way. Casting was awful for a few reasons. They rushed the ending so quickly that I didn't even realize that it was over until I saw the credits rolling. I considered burning the reel of film if I could just figure out how to get into that screening room. Sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him. He plays a very bland agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer type roll us 24 fans love. This movie will disappoint in all areas.

The reason why these movies don't work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better. Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter. Glenn Close is such an amazing actress, very under rated, but her taking on Cruella De Vil, she's good. But let's face it, this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case. Also, as cute as the puppies were, it just works more for the animation. 's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix. I wouldn't really recommend 102 Dalmations, it's alright, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, this is just the same thing.\n",

Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer harsh self inflicted pain. b) See just how bad a film can be. \"This is one film where I can use the cliché \"there's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back\" with some justification!\" says the critic. \"There's one film in this movie where you can say \"there is one scene in this film that I can't get back,\" he adds.\n",

      "Drew Barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods, not only in her career, but in her personal life too. After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality. While she has recovered from that dark past, this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days. Holly is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother. Unlike De Palma's underrated thriller, \"Doppelganger\" is for the most part a mediocre film that never fulfills it's purpose. The script is full of clichés and De Palma's influence is quite obvious. While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance. The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances. Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them. The make-up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie. The bizarre over-use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing. Barrymore gets a 3/10 for her performance. The actress is flawless every second of the film. The film was shot in New York City and Los Angeles. It was directed by Michael Douglas and shot in Technicolor.\n",

      "American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile. The \"important\" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even wrote them. Some of the same characters were returning for Beta House. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porno-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing. The movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental.\n",

Young teenage boys who like to see naked women, crude humour and beer drinking will love Beta House, everyone else can pretty much look away. American Pie: Beta House pushes the boundaries of what technology can do. When people have created spaceships, landscapes and creatures using CGI, Beta House decides to use this technology to create this technology.  Beta House shows more nudity then The Naked Mile, which is surprising considering the previous installments title. Yes the women are beautiful, but if I am the one who thinks there is too much nudity then you. The American Pie series has fallen from a realm of reality into a fantasy world. None of the events in this film would ever happen, if they ever did then I need to attend this school IMMEDIATELY. as well just have made a porno. There is a \"Deer Hunter\" scene in the film, but to make it \"funny\" for today's audience they decided to substitute bullets wit horse semen. Instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head, or face, they place the gun in their mouths. The film at first seems like it will be about the boys trying to get into the frat house. Then it shifts to a competition between nerds and the boys. It goes a little \"Revenge of the Nerds\" on us for a bit and it seems out of place. The film is not funny. Nor does it seem to be focused, the story is pathetic and the so called crude humour that the series has been known for doesn't shock. Skip this lame installment and any future future installments. For some unknown reason they seem to have found their way to my eyes. as well. I do not know why I have seen all the entries in the series, but for some unknown reasons I have. seen them.\n",

      "The best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film, which is always appreciated. There are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. There is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot. Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. This film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley, the acting is poor. If seen from a teen point of view, I guess that it's better.\n",

      "For those with little time on their hands, I'll sum it up quickly, in one word...pathetic. You can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you. Want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap. Despite the average nature of the original movie, it's still a thousand times funnier than this dreck. The plot is predictable, and sometimes you actually feel like you're watching a school play. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually watch it. , like the kind you need to convince yourself Jar Jar is real) Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed at was how socially unaware the scriptwriters appear to be. There is no acting talent to speak of, all you get is a bunch of pretty boys trying to make us laugh. The characters have to complete a set number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House. This is dealt with mostly by a series of very brief montages that imply that they are completing the tasks but we see little to no evidence of it actually happening. Its a very lazy way of telling a story. It also misses opportunities to be funny in doing so. The female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is get naked for no apparent reason. You braindeads that only seek T&A will not be disappointed. If you buy this on DVD you will be contributing to the downfall of society.\n",

Now him and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joining Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) at college.  Beta and Gek go into battle with the banned, for forty years, Greek Games to beat each other in, with the loser moving out. The last champion of the games, Noah Levenstein aka Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees the people unhooking bras, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching a greased pig.  Beta House win when Edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. Also starring Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull.

      "The first three American Pie movies weren't the most amazing movies that I'd ever seen. While they weren't masterpieces compared to the three \"American Pie Presents\" films, I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie? Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? Who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live? It should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart. The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes. The biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting. While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years. Eugene Levy is the only big name in this movie. Most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows. Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating (there are things that he could teach to tropical skin) Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film. Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating. The ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating. Twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage. Craven had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released. This kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror film. The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination. Nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away. this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating. ulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class. The long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive. This pie is filled with road apples.\n",

      "The Waterdance is an interesting, and promising premise, but unfortunately, it fails to deploy. What ensues instead is largely Hollywood schmaltz, with some interesting moments. Certainly the cast (Eric Stoltz, William Forsythe, Wesley Snipes, et al) is brilliant, but their talents are wasted. Most of the characters are stereotypes of one kind or another, and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable. I suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being \"crippled\" or \"weak\", but it makes for an entirely annoying experience. Admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent disabilities go through. In addition to its character problems, the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many Hollywood movies suffer from. By the film's conclusion, the Eric Stoltz character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person, but since he is such a narcissistic monster from the beginning of the film to the end we couldn't care less. The syndrome doesn't really have an official name, but you might call it \"Inexplicable Forgiveness Syndrome\" It goes something like this: characters abuse the crap out of each other, and then without so much as an apology, all is forgiven. The most egregious example of IFS in The Waterdance is a sequence in which, after being called the n-word by William Forsythe's racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene, the Wesley Snipes character whoops it up with the same Forsy the character in the next scene. It is without so much as an \"Oh yeah, sorry about that business back there where I, you know, called you the n -word\" Do these people actually watch these movies before they release them, or do they just film them with their eyes closed, kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number, and call it a day's work?\n",

He would have been better off working with more of the Kubricks of the film world. \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" really is a poor film and a dire choice on Sellers' part in terms of character. It's almost Sellers playing a Niven cad without the joviality. He certainly does not convince, try as he might. Hawn and Sellers really do not establish any genuine chemistry; this is no easy, genial romance of the like perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is very artificial seeming, all the way through. Danvers' character is a dry procurer of ladies, but he doesn't really change from that in a way that convinces. might, or create an interesting character. This is truly one of the most anaemic, complacent, misguided and lightly dull films I have ever seen.

In short, the script had the seed of a good idea, but needed quite a bit of reworking. Third, the show is a little too self-aware. The Brendan Fraser in-jokes were just a bit over the top. Other gags with the Narrator, especially a couple of interactions near the end. Fourth, a bit more attention could have been given to the CGI work. In the first it was hard to tell that Shemp wasn't a real elephant. Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough.

After warnings from a Nun & Vicar Scott begins to believe that Donald is evil & the cause of all the deaths. The script by Benjamin Henry & Austin Laurel is terrible & simply can't match The Omen (2006) The Asylum seem to specialise in making low budget horror films which are usually rip-offs of some recent successful big budget horror film. to say 666: The Child is really rather poor. Every character in 666: The Child is some form of the main character's from The Omen. There's a real lack of incident, there's barely any gore & the plot is poor. Donald killing a dentist because they were trying to fix his teeth is just so random & needless. Director Perez does alright I suppose, it's competent if nothing else. There's virtually no blood or gore, there's a few sprays of blood, a cut off hand & someone gets a circular saw stuck in their face. The references to the number 6 also becomes annoying & are very unsubtle. 666: The Child is a poor mans The Omen rip-off, I'd sooner watch either the original or the remake over this any day of the week. The acting isn't that great but at the same time I've seen worse. No atmosphere thanks to a throughly bland contemporary setting. The first 666 went straight-to-DVD. Followed by the sequel 666: The Beast (2007) which also went straight toDVD. Not recommended. not recommended. Follows by the sequels 666: the Beast ( 2007) and 666:the Beast (2008)\n",

It's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office. I found the story very simple and full of clichés, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. The film-maker was by the door. time.

      "STUDIO 666 (aka THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another sub-par slasher that has the appearance of a straight-to-DVD movie. Every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review. The plot of this movie must have been done hundreds, if not thousands of times. The movie only has a slight twist (and one that is badly handled) to the movie. The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it does fare better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM. The acting in the movie is very poor for the most part. The actress who played Dora was an exception to this. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. , some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie. The direction was equally poor. The villains did not seem the least bit menacing, every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension, atmosphere was non-existent and the camera-work was incredibly basic. The music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie. The dialogue is unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to move the movie up (or should it be down) to the so-bad-it's-good level. , STUDIO 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects. I recommend this only to those who are fans of straight-to-DVD movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made.\n",

After watching it, I can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it, it's best to pass over this one.*Major Spoil* Lead singer, Cassidy, kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend Neil to notice her. 3 months later, the band is trying to decide if they're going to finish the album or not. To try and see what Cassidy would have wanted, they go to see an old psychic friend of hers. In his card reading, Dr. Meso turns up four straight Death cards for the remaining band members. Even without the approval of their deceased friend, they decide to go ahead and finish the album. But while in the bathroom, Cassidy's best-friend, Dora, catches a glimpse of her deceased friend. That's when the killing begins. While the narrative hangs together for the first part, once Cassidy is resurrected, everything falls apart. Too many warping effects, unnecessary zooms, and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film. An incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either. From this point on, the whereabouts of Cassidy are shown, but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence. One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk, when a character enters in the next, she's nowhere to be found. The story is the driving force behind this piece. As for the performances, most are particularly wooden. Some though are interesting, but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it's acting.\n",

The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor. When her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island. \"Savage Island\" is a very low-budget movie, with a stupid screenplay, amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is totally absurd, and there are many unbelievable situations. The Young family does not accept the trade, and they initiate a deadly war between families. There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject. I believe this film was filmed with a home video camera so awful the images are. The good cast deserved a better material to work. My vote is four. \"Ilha de Sangue\" (\"Island of Blood\") is a Portuguese island off the coast of Portugal. It is known as the \"Island of Blood\" because of the blood found on its surface.\n",

Prince is a great musician and Music is the one area where Purple Rain excels. Even the score is mesmerising, and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it's not. A good loner character should at least have some talkative moments, unfortunately Prince's character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film. Everything just seems a little off here, which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live. We aren't ever allowed to get inside of it. Prince and Morris's lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here. It's exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it.\n",

Those were times when other winds of unrest swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the U.S. 'Portugal' is a well-conceived drama about the social unrest in Portugal in the 1970s and 1980s. The film follows the events leading up to the unrest, and the events that led to it. It is the first time the film has been released in UK cinemas. The film presupposes that viewers already have ample knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portugues film industry, but - it was trite and shallow. \"Un regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution\" - a warm regard? Try describing Allende's overthrown and murder with a a \"warm regard\"? Try describing Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the whole line-up of overthrows, and civil rebellions!

This film is shot entirely in English, is chock full of Anglo actors, and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad....but not funny! Who can we blame for this rubbish? The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect. The film does feature a couple of beauties.

      "The King Maker has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest, pedestrian scripts and story development on film. The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch) whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked, captured and thrown into Siam. Fernando is a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses. He is purchased by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies) There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul) are imprisoned together. oe Hassadeevichit) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to take over the rule of Siam. Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families. The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas. poorly written dialog, making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles. It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects.\n",

As another member said, this movie is a good example of 'how not to act' I haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time. The actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. Mix that with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. The rest of the cast with their accents (fake or contrived) is equally heinous. The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the movie. Totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago. Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film. I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating.

      "Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. By the last few years of the Thirties, swing-style big bands were recording the year's biggest popular hits. The Swing Era, also called the Big Band Era, has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. The summer of 1935 was one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream America's youth. Since radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits. There are a few interesting musical moments here and there in Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and His Orchestra's \"Sing, Sing, Sing,\" there isn't a lot to commend. The film was in production only a year and a half or so after Goodman's Palomar Ballroom engagement. ford sing. \"I love you, I love you,\" he says to the crowd. \"That's what love is all about,\" he adds. \"It's about being able to say that you love me\"\n",

The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clichéd, not thought-out, and outright dumbest dumbest films ever made. This is the cheesiest and most clichéd thing I've ever seen put on screen. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies. Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money.

Things that seem rational at the time, later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity. For me it was a film, D-War: Dragon Wars. In hindsight, I should have. The English language lacks sufficient nuance to make this film work. By the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory, fifteen minutes into the picture, I had the sudden, sinking revelation. I knew just how badly every point would all suck. \"This film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers Power Rangers. depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is\" \"It was infested with close calls, miraculous escapes, and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst\" Imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest-looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade. First take the rasta-talking army of amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they are ready to club Navy Seals. Next, take close approximations of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (You can even call him Ethan as a \"subtle\" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them lots of film no film. Add a raspy-voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras, angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of King Kong. Lay them all out in no particular order in modern day Los Angeles. At several points during this picture, I found myself saying out loud, \"Make the bad movie stop,\" and breaking into tears. After summer school, and a lot of physical therapy, it might possibly pass for a C level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it. If you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourself for hideous, unspoken sins against humanity, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of Star Wars, then this is the film for you. If you're more of a sci-fi fan, this could be the film of your life. The film is out now on Blu-ray and DVD, with more to come.\n",

Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up, yep dragon palace. and its right under LA i guess. Some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestle/make love whatever. Tuskan Shredder could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasn't helpful and he could go in your dreams when that wouldn't do any good.

Jason Behr, whom i thought was awesome in Roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that's pretentious, spacey and Patrick Dempsey\"ish\" He was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi-god of evil then John Barrymore was at playing Richard the III or Hamlet.

      "I'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in IMDb rating system. this movie was horrible. It was very badly acted, the story was poorly written, the action was unbelievable. I doubt even the Salvation Army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film. I was hoping for a feast of CGI and fighting masterfully done, but that isn't what happened. The martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash-back scene. The CGI was not done well either. The bad guy's voice was dubbed by the voice-over of Imotep from The Mummy movies. Since I mentioned the fight scene, I'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler, but only to the purists I suppose.\n",

      "After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie \"Gwoemul\" (aka \"The Host\") of 2006, successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic. Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill? The only \"reason\" I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date. Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 \"Dragonheart\", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities. I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one. I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem \"Arirang\" being played at the very end. I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it. I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).\n",

      "My original review of this film was simply the word sh*t written 2000 times over. Although this was a very accurate critique, I felt my review should be a little more descriptive. I will start with the lead actress; her facial expression doesn't change once in this film, she doesn't show fear, happiness or depression. She is an emotionless husk who I'm guessing has had too much botox. The only thing that tops the hideous acting is the directing, storyline and inaccuracies in plot. I have seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie. The lead actor, whose hair demands more attention than he did, was mediocre at best and did not once make me feel like he was genuinely in peril. This film would not have been bad if it was trying to be crap on purpose. It was trying so hard to be a serious action flick that I couldn't even laugh. I believe I now have a brain tumour from watching this film. If I bought this on DVD I would smash the DVD to pieces, burn it then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure.\n",

Three second clips jammed together with background music is a DVD extra for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime-time television. Who knows why it was slotted there, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of episodes that have aired within the past year.\n",

      "Ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him? Well they exist, in many forms. Well you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe. The Brian Jamestown Massacre's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry. However, The Dandy Warhols, lead by Courtney, did make it. Anton is a \"genius\" because he plays rock music. His music is considered \"post-modern retro but the future\" He wants to bring out a \"revolution... through rock music\" The documentary itself doesn't really lend itself to showcasing any of Anton's talent, because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don't really have the time to focus on that. So instead we watch Anton, \"the genius\", the socio-maniacal loser, be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music. Whether he did or not I won't know, because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it. Anton doesn't deserve the attention they seek, the hope and admiration of all those different people. This movie plays like a two-hour rough-cut VH1 special for a reason. It's all about the image and the attention. The only interesting character in this film is Joel, and that's because of anyone in this documentary, Joel is the only person who seems to have any fun. Maybe it's because he's the tambourine man. The rest of them are all \"rock stars\"! They deserve our attention, and admiration, and interest, and engagements! They are out there to \"save rock and roll\" This documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull--because music execs have to deal with people like Anton for a living. \"selfish of them not to mention me (Anton) as an inspiration.\" What a load. People like Anton are best left forgotten. ><br />--PolarisDiB. <br /> --PolariDiB's official Facebook page. Click here for more information on the Polaris DiB website.

      "Ruth Roman's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco jump-started this all-star Warner Bros. salute to patriotism and song. Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and an Air Force Corporal. Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so, and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant. Jane Wyman sings, too, in a hospital bedside reprise following Doris Day's lead, causing one to wonder, \"Did they run out of sets?\" Low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render \"Starlift\" strictly a second-biller. time and place. Still, the low-rent produce is a plus for the film.\n",

      " STARLIFT is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea. Not once during the film is the name 'Korea' mentioned. We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men are. Released in December 1951 by Warner Brothers, STARLIFT is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio's star-studded home-front morale booster \"Hollywood Canteen\" This 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in LA.  STARLIFT features two Air Force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet Nell Wayne. Joan Crawford, John Garfield, and Barbara Stanwyck to Peter Lorre, Bette Davis, Sydney Greenstreet and more. To describe STARLIFT as a sloppy, lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy and lazy. This threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values.\n",

A very incoherent attempt at a plot line. The director presents the material in an extremely \"arrogant\" way and worse, extremely incoherently. The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was. at 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer to CARE by the end of it. \"Seul contre tous\" offers no intellectual study, and while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling. All we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together\" It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket. Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolish. \"It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning. then please watch this film, taking into account what I have said of it\"\n",

      "\"L'Intrus\" definitely falls into the first category, but it's not so awful as \"Trouble Every Day\" or \"J'ai pas sommeil\" Claire Denis has yet to make a movie as personal and as moving as her first one. You get a lot of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera lingered on him at such length that I got annoyed by that curly forelock. There was certainly some action--gruesome murders, a man's search for a son. There may even have been a plot, but one viewing wasn't enough to figure it out. Two viewings are, I fear, out of the question. The dialogue in a Denis movie rarely amounts to more than five pages, double spaced and with ample margins. In \"Chocolat\" the silence is sublime; in \"L'Intrus,\" it's just dull. If you. liked \"Friday Evening\" with its shots of the folds in heavy drapes and bedsheets, you might appreciate the aesthetics of \"L.Intrus\"\n",

      "The Blob starts with one of the most bizarre theme songs ever, sung by an uncredited Burt Bacharach of all people! After this unnerving opening credits sequence The Blob introduces us, the viewer that is, to Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen as Steven McQueen) & his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) who are parked on their own somewhere & witness what looks like a meteorite falling to Earth in nearby woods. An old man (Olin Howland as Olin Howlin) who lives in a cabin also sees it & goes to investigate. He finds a crater & a strange football sized rock which splits open when he unwisely pokes it with a stick. Laying in the centre of the meteorite is a strange jelly like substance which sticks to the stick. It then slides up the stick & attachés itself to the old man's hand. Meanwhile Steve & Jane are quietly driving along minding their own business. Alden 'Stephen' Chase as Steven Chase. The town's police, Lieutenant Dave (Earl Rowe) & the teenage hating Sergeant Jim Bert (John Benson) unsurprisingly don't don't find out what happened. The blob continues to eat it's way through the town. Steve sets about finding proof of it's existence & convincing the police about the threat it posses not just to their town but the entire world. I was throughly disappointed by this. The script by Kay Linaker as Kate Phillips & Theodore Simonson is an absolute bore & extremely dull not making the most of it's strongest aspects. The Blob focuses on the tiresome dramatics & conflicts between the teenagers & police. For most of the film the blob itself almost seems inconsequential & somewhat forgotten. No explanation is given for what the blob is or it's origins other than it came from space, how long did it take them to come up with that? The dialogue is clunky & silly as well, as are people's actions & decision making. I love the part when a nurse named Kate (Lee Paton as Lee Payton, did anyone use their real name in this thing?) is confronted by the blob. There's no blood or violence so don't worry about that, the special effects on the blob itself aren't too bad considering but it barely has any screen time & moves very slowly. The acting is terrible, McQueen is supposed to be a teenager when in reality he was 28 years old & it shows. Same thing goes for most of the other 'teenage' cast members & everyone generally speaking are wooden & unconvincing in their roles. The Blob ( 1988) is one of those films that probably sounds good on paper & is well known as being a 'classic' but is in actual fact a huge disappointment when finally seen. Blob is very basic, dark static photography, dull direction & forgettable production values. The blob eats only three or four people throughout the entire film. The remake features the blob all the way through & it virtually eats an entire town. I'll give the film two stars & give that wonderful main theme song one on it's own.\n",

      "\"The '60s\" is a two-part miniseries on HBO. Co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for the series. \"Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam\" was also co-written by Couturies. This presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production. It doesn't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time. Like so many of its ilk, it's seen from the point of view of one family. But the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s. The makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character. Garry Trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly. Jerry O'Connell, Jordana Brewster, Jeremy Sisto, Julia Stiles and Charles S. Dutton give their material the old college try. David Alan Grier in a rare straight role as activist Fred Hampton, and Rosanna Arquette (in an uncredited cameo in part 2) is always welcome. What isn't welcome is how \"The '60s\" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs. \"American Dreams\" and \"The Wonder Years\" did it all much, much better. Capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending.\n",

      "The premise of this movie: African-American = Strong... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun on Omar Epps and a Jewish guy. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist. When the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men. The scenes where Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid. This movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud. The overly long slow-motion between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make. Do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest.\n",

      "This picture presents African-Americans as savage, uncultured, violent, inarticulate, reefer-smoking sociopaths. Fudge(Ice Cube) and his posse of homies are continuously disrespectful toward others in the dorm. The skinheads are presented as a covert group of underachievers who share a pad off campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They do commit serious crime such as battery and rape, yet they're not as repulsive nor as threatening as Fudge and Dreads(Busta Rhymes) are. Fudge and Dreads are stated as students at the Columbus University yet we never see them in class and it is completely unclear how they pay their tuition. One is only left to speculate that the weed they smoke has something to do with their finances. Their characters are developed only through their compulsive whining and xenophobia. Kristen was assured by Taryn(Jennifer Connely) that she holds no accountability in that matter. Despite willfully jumping into a guy's bed she wasn't ready for sexual intercourse and was viciously taken advantage of. Cole Hauser's acting, and Laurence Fishburne's accent are the only reasons I can think of to watch it. The writer/director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. The director stressed contraception thoroughly.\n",

Most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, lesbian feminist) The film bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. The changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. I don't want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. Another problem I have with this movie is that it's supposed to be \"gritty\" and \"hard-hitting,\" but they make Nazis the bad guys. Everybody thinks Nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. The film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, clumsy way. -school-special like, manner. Being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-Nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue. Avoid at all costs.\n",

      "I don't understand why people would praise this garbage. Its wrong, stupid, unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else. The film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in College. It has no grasps on reality. Several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs Bust A Rhymes. Another critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters. From the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful (?) black people. The storyline which I will explain now revolves around three characters. its an insult to both black and white people. I am a white male and I know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them characteristics exclusively due to their race. Overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie. I don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess. If you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see American History X. ys.ys. Just avoid this mess. Don't get involved in the politics of it. It's not worth the hassle.

The woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one. In any event, he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas. When the frat boy tries to call the woman, her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone. The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube, et al, who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the Frat boy into repeated and prolonged \"apologies\" to roommate for racist remarks. ) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned.

One good thing about the film is that it does show that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large. The colleges are not places to build character , develop potential, or enhance personal advancement. 't and that's where the films falls apart. Singleton ,it seems, had a pretty bad experience at Southern California. Through this film he lets it all hang out. There is no need to beat around the bush here. The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie. Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were unavailable. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character ,of the three main characters, changed the most in the film. And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor. Life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over. The film, then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to. Not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest. all.\n",

      "Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever. Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face. By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than uplifting. Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation. Marisa Tomei isn't given much to do with her character. When Andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship. It really doesn't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive is mesmerizing. Hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain, but it's hard to root against him. Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH's great performance and it's family train wreck nature. Just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for, because there really aren't.\n",

And why his wife didn't leave him before. On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman. Also it's a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime.

Quite on the contrary, I am a radical: a Libertarian. I dare say, by and for show-offs. I find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes, nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive. Why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism. With two exceptions: the episode of Burkina Faso -- almost amusing --, and the one from India -- which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack. All other nine episodes, essentially and extremely boring and emotionless, can be listed in two different categories. Makhmalbaf's (Iran), Lelouch's (France), Tanovic's (Bosnia-Herzegovina), Gonzalez Inarritu's (Mexico); Gitaï's (Israel); Penn's (USA) can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion. about the thousands of victims. Chahine (Egypt) vindicates the suicide bombers; Loach (UK) considers the 9/11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet. There's some kind of error shared by many, including some Americans, and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn't commercially screened in the States. It pretends to be obscure. It is, instead, quite ludicrous. Even in Buenos Aires, where Peronism and other forms of Fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants, the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters.

Raggedy Ann and Andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children's cartoon. It tries also to be a musical. and over schedule, and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super-talented individual like Williams can go, given the right circumstances. There are a number of problems with the film, but let's start with Raggedy Ann and Andy themselves. They're the stars of the show, yet they have no personalities. It's beautifully animated, for the most part, though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention. The toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable, but they're actually bizarre and disturbing. The two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this. 're relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain, whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous French doll. Yes, this is supposed to be a children's film! Then there's the music, none of which is memorable, and all ofwhich is sung by actors who can't sing. And to add insult to injury, there's a lot of singing in this film. The Greedy is a living, breathing. belching, farting, constantly eating pool of taffy. The film is so trippy, creepy and ultimately, ultimately, wrong. , you'll hardly believe what you're seeing - this is as close to a drug-free psychedelic experience as I've ever seen on film. After a l-o-n-g time spent with the Greedy, along comes the psychotic Sir Leonard Looney and his master King KooKoo, whose throne resembles a urinal. or McCay / Little Nemo cartoons, for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it, probably. All this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it, but there isn't. These scenes are just strange, and very, very long. Even at a meagre 86 minutes in length, the film feels like a never-ending ordeal. There's a non-event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out. Animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how Williams managed to flub this one.\n",

      "Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend, Babette. From there, craziness ensues. There's the Greedy, the Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a bunch of other characters. Babette is annoying and a bit too whiny. singing show tunes, all of which just made the movie weirder. While most of the Looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting. While I personally wouldn't recommend this movie, even I have to admit, it does have its charming moments. Also, there was Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. But, honestly, even these things didn't make the movie any better.\n",

      "\"No, Luciano\" is a more apt title or response to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to singing. Not that he's a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks. Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. It's Harrold that spoils things and after watching her here I am not surprised she didn't become a star. Nice scenery in the movie to enjoy, good shots of San Francisco and Italy. About the second half of it. about the second part of it about the first half of the film.

      "Giorgio Pavarotti's \"No, Giorgio\" was one of the worst films ever made. While bad and far from a great work of art, there was a lot to like about the film. Movie's biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth. The problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a \"romance\" that consists of a horny married middle-aged man and a seemingly desperate lady. Pavarotti tells Harrold that he loves his wife and \"this is just fun\". Wow, talk about romantic dialog!! Sadly, if they had just changed the script a little bit and made Pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic Hollywood films. Sadly, even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti couldn't save this film. Towards the end of the film, there are some amazing scenes in New York where the set is just incredible. I really wanted to like the film more, but it was a truly bad film. Sadly, from what I have read, this film might be a case of art imitating life, as Pavarotti's own life later had some parallels to this film. you might have heard.\n",

      "An attempt at crossover to appeal to those who don't appreciate opera, exploiting the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, it fails badly. All that is desirable in this movie is the opera, and one can best find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot is weak and trite. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to pick off a few juicy tidbits (the opera music) hanging above the mud. We have other ways in which to appreciate the great Pavarotti. It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst Films if more people remembered it and gave it some votes. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor had he not shown such a superb voice. However effective he is as an actor (opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have rescued this turkey of a script. I give it a polite 3 of 10 because someone may have become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and of opera because of this movie. I give it 3 out of 10.\n",

      "The Film Snob gives this movie a 21 out of 21. The film is so tedium-inducing that only clawing at your own face will do. (See our blog What-To-See-Next for details on our rating system.) Tear-jerking third act may bring you to your knees if you haven't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then. In a season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create. Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth-tier celebrity/entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a phone call from New York City. Sidney Dunst is at work in New York City, doing allllllll the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are (1) Jewish, and (2) gay. He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the industry's hottest movie star, when she leaves it in the magazine's offices. orst of all, he totally alienates Alison Olsen (played by winsome scripting-confusion by Kristen Dunst) Except for the one tear-duct set piece in which True Love prevails. Publisher Harding is supposed to be a son-of-a-bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over. The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy. The \"comedy\" of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel. , and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception. This Thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It is uninspiring, unfunny, unredeemable, and not even rentable. The world is in a state of emergency in the U.S. after the midterm elections. President Barack Obama said he would be willing to meet with President-elect Hillary Clinton to discuss the state of the country.\n",

Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight. Pegg plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry.

      "The sitcom \"The league of Gentlemen\" follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village \"Royston Vasey\" The different scenes are linked together by their common setting. Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local Job Centre. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to loose her job. So when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman, she does not allow him to go. , a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about \"her\" sexual conversion.Furthermore the vet, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them. In one case, he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room, where a dog lays in his basket. On the assumption that the dog is the sick animal, he euthanizes him. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the \"real\" sick animal. In my opinion, the actors play very well. By playing women, the scenes become comical. The costumes are suited to the actors, too. Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, for example Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look grey and are decayed. Even the village sign is ominous: \"Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave\"\n",

I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to walk out of the theater/press 'stop' I watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustration. The acting was very, very good, but that was about it. Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his 'downfall' While we understand that he and Cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no--nothing. The film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out-of-place and confusing pace. I can keep a 'take it as it is' basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off. It took me a good chunk of time to figure out that Pierre WAS the ex.  CU just leaves you hanging. It has an air of pretension in its 'we're not gonna tell you a damned thing, figure it out for yourself' presentation. It's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing. \"The whole story was just too disappointing. the whole story is just too disappointed,\" he said. \"It's like they didn't want to tell the truth,\" he added. \"They don't want the world to know the truth\"\n",

There is a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing.

      "After watching this film, I was left with a two very annoyances about this film: why did they make Chen's character this \"McGuyver hit-man\" and Lee's character such an incompetent idiot? Chen'scharacter's background is that he was raised in an underground Cambodian orphanage for blood thirsty fighter.  Si in the first ten minutes of the film, it is established that Chen is malnutrition-ed, unmodernized,and has only thing going for him, his \"dog\" brawling fighting style of some sort. Despite this situation, Chen manages to out-shoot every policeman (even managing to ricochet a bullet off a metal metal. Lee's character...okay, I get it, he's depressed and he's got some baggage, but wow, can he do anything right? One moment, they try to make him cool, composed and ready to take care of business, and the next moment, he just just doesn't care. My biggest problem with this movie is that it is presented in a manner that film makers are trying to get the audience to sympathize with with Lee. First scene he runs into Chen, and he manages to misses him, from approx 15 ft, multiple times. Toward the end of that scene, Lee watches Chen as his close friend and coworker gets slowly stabbed in the neck with a long knife for a good full 5 seconds, while holding a gun to Chen face, at a 10 ft distance. 's character and that he is just \"killing to survive\" That would be a lot easier if I didn't just watch Chen kill innocent people throughout the whole awful movie. Overall, Chen's character is a just a cold blooded killer who kills for what he wants, even if its just a free ride. \"Dog Bite This DVD\" is one made for the nut-hugging Chen fans. My 3 stars go to some of the interesting director/camera work who got in some nice shots.\n",

      "By the end, you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with, failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men. The main characters, an emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. Although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, by the half-way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. The suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score. The white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to US movies. An interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget, low budget film. Throw in some grisly from-behind choke scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and you get the average bland Asian thriller. And just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of Shakespearean tragedy, you realize that it's not an ending at all, but rather a transition into a wacky country-music montage about peace and serenity. \"Tetanus\" is about a true killer that still lurks amongst us. The film is about tetanus, a disease that can be fatal to the human body. The movie is based on a true story about a man who died of tetanus.\n",

I don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination. 2) To connect the movie to the title, there were barking or dog wimping sounds during the fight scenes and rape scene, which is totally irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. 3) WHY THE HECK DID THE COPS NOT SHOOT THE KILLER? During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt, it was very clear that the LEFT foot of the girls was hurt, so how the heck in the next scene that she's lending all her weight on her left foot? And this is the actress nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are off sync. 6) I am guessing that this movie is trying to bring awareness of the brutality and violence among children in South East Asia. Cops are beating CI to a pulp and then if they cooperate, they give them marijuana and coke? This is overall the worst movie. I truly feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadist and sick person.\n",

      "Gen is about a young doctor with an ill mother. The film starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. As soon as she steps into the garden of the hospital, she sees the death body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positive sides of the movie of course. Actings are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary. . I think the final shock should have been spread into the through out of the movie. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie is supposed to be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Lastly, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I have recently found out that he is only 21 years old. That made me feel more positive about him. I am not going to rate this film * out of ***** though.\n",

      "it is of course very nice to see improvements on Turkish movie industry, however, i would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. starting from the script, which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think. especially the cheesiness of the dialogs, which were putting the audience in a position that, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations. did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals, to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use?????!!!!!!also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient, with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film. and that scene was so suitable for \"Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir\" title!! Gen is a total disappointment. copy from Hannibal, also appearance of Togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie! i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview. it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Night. amalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet!!!!hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry!\n",

Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Hanks' good performance aside, though, I certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic, it turns into a very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster. , the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, gets the wrong son (and the mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a weird sort of father/son bonding movie. Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note, it's really very dark throughout.\n",

The last time I felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was when I saw The Office. This flick fumbled from start to finish. The script was flunky material. Awful writing all around. \"Murderer of love\"? \"Love is an ability\"? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck American Beauty's writer(s)... trying too hard. What's with Carell's character? The guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love? Let's face it. Their conversation sucked. They both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes.  IMDb, you need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. The first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds, or by flunky's hired by the studio. Check out The Family Stone's rating... if that's if that can be called a rating. If this is a mid 5, then this absolutely has got to be a 2... and that's pushing it. If it's a mid 4, then it's probably a 3 or 4.\n",

      "To my taste, either they are black and rippingly funny, or so light in tone to be unsatisfying. That's a self-important way of saying I wanted to like \"The Man In The White Suit\" but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time. \"It's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress,\" Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the Man. fabric that can't be broken or made dirty. Using a factory lab for his latest experiment, he toils against limitations both material and human. For a comedy, \"White Suit\" is not funny. It's a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit-takes. The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney toils at. I've never seen Guinness less affecting in a movie, even though he looks impossibly young and earnest. He seems so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general he played in \"Doctor Zhivago\" Like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film, it's leaned on too long. ultry charms of young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his one real ally in his fight against \"shabbiness and dirt\" Supporting players make \"White Suit\" work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger of \"Bride Of Frankenstein\" fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like Nosferatu. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical medical doctor. Mandy Miller as a little girl steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else. Most of the scenes are played so straight that one wouldn't think director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before. Roger MacDougall's play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster but fails to present dull Sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights. ies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. Yet the Ealings never seem to do this. \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" and \"The Ladykillers\" are classics this way. \"White Suit\" is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere.\n",

This would have been a much better movie if they'd just left that character out of the story. He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe somebody decided that if they couldn't make Ryan believable they'd just make him obnoxious. Who cares if a spoiled, whining, obnoxious jerk is dying? Not me. The movie would have made a much better movie without Ryan's self-pitying interruptions. The other two characters, and the actors playing them, are very much more interesting.

I'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my mom's portrayal of him, all my readings on him, and the video tapes I've seen of him talking. First of all, the camera angles were horrible. The acting was terrible and I couldn't even bear to watch it. ennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a \"very anal man\" and was a 'follow the rule book' kind of guy. He wasn't as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt. Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew, he confessed this, but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also. Yet through-out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim's faces and acting like he cared about the well-being of them.

      "Raptor Planet is a loose sequel to the 2004 Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island. Raptor Planet lies in the latter category of bad movies. The movie is barely watchable. The plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. The effects that bring the dinosaurs to life are some of the worst looking effects I've seen in a low budget film. The gore effects are even unconvincing. The plot is simple. The human cast are picked off and eaten. By now, we've come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released. This is the first killer dinosaur movie I've seen where I actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks. While Raptor Island wasn't a good film to begin with, its a masterpiece compared to its sequel. \"This is quite possibly the worst movie Syfy has ever aired. It's darn near unwatchable\"\n",

      "So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert's book \"I hated, hated,. hated this movie\" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book. He said at the end of his original review \"Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor\" So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. Richard Dreyfuss plays a gangster in \"North\" The movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching DreyFuss's girlfriend while Drey fuss was at work. The script was not written well at all. The movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. After that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. . Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or found that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe. I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that \"Independence Day\" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of \"Mad Dog Time\" says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place. Every copy of \"Mad Dog Time\" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.\n",

PS--after saying this, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin is going to find me and kick my butt. In the first half, Harlow's character was amazingly stupid but at least it was believable. But when she was sent to prison, it was no longer believable. Most of it was not because of the firsthalf of the film. All clichés until the final ridiculous marriage scene. The bottom line is that this sequence is embarrassingly dumb.

Director Dusty Nelson ('Effects (1989)') does an earnest job with what he had and plays it for what it is. The score is a chintzy arrangement.\n",

The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something. The fight scenes may not be great.. but they are plentiful. The overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles.\n",

Characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising. Even 80's ninja-flick-fan, who understands the esthetic of trash-movies, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. It simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer, neither in visual level nor in plot. the ending scene, which by itself reduced movie's (trash)value. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in \"Enter the Ninja\" falls behind Sakura killer's American-ninjas. In all, one of the most futile ninja-flicks, I've ever seen.

Caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures. Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a W.H.O medic who is left devastated when his black wife Anansa (Beverly Johnson) goes missing during an aid trip to an African tribal village. He gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by Suleiman (Peter Ustinov) - and he sets off on a continent-wide pursuit. Big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. The film is based on a best-seller entitled Ebano, by the little-known author Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa. The suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. aver (he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances) Caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again. There are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole Ashanti is quite slow-moving.\n",

Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen. Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos.\n",

We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden. Every taste in hero is catered for. It was pretty obvious that it would be crap even from the outset. That ludicrously mismatched jaunty-jazz theme music had all the atmospheric conviction of elevator Muzak. Who Who Who? audience still went away disappointed. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do. employing a jazz band when a scene depicted the steamy jungles of central Africa, or the endless Sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop? Definitely a serious goof-ball. This director should have taken the trouble to watch 'Lawrence of Arabia', or even Sergio Leone's westerns. The confusion surrounding her loss and the tension of the chase was tangible. Rex Harrison kept popping-up out of no-where like some wily old genii, to put him back on track whenever the narrative stumbled. At least the photography was rather good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. Action scenes were also contrived and stilted, with such ineptly choreographed fight sequences that they might have been staged in a first-year drama class. And, of course, the players must fight to a jazz accompaniment - as you do.\n",

      "'The Dream Machine' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of Corey Haim's career. Here, Haim plays nonchalant college boy, Bernie, who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl's attention. A woman decides to reward her faithful piano tuner--Bernie--with a slick Porsche Turbo. However, unbeknownst to the woman, and unfortunate for Bernie, is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk. This is a low-grade action fizzle as many of Haim's films like this are (see The Double O Kid). Despite being part action, part romantic comedy, this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minutes. The lack of real immediacy and emergency between Bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result, inappreciable. To add injury to insult, the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self-evident songs you would hear in Team America. The actor's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered. Viewers just looking for early 90s b-comedy fluff to pass the time will expect mediocrity.\n",

There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on. But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). CRIPES. The scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is absolute genius.\n",

I know that the Mexican people have some odd ideas about religion, mixing up ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead isn't half as scary as their take on Santa Claus. Santa is a Peeping Tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his 'eye in the sky' This is so he can tell who's been naughty or nice(with an emphasis on those who are naughty, I'd bet) Santa's nemesis is...the Devil?! What is this, Santa our Lord and Savior? Weird. Satan sends one of his minions, a mincing, prancing devil named Pitch, to try to screw up Christmas. The reindeer are mechanical wind-up toys! Pitch is totally ineffectual. He tries to talk some children into being bad, but doesn't have much luck. I was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl Lupe. All that she wants is a doll for Christmas, but he parents can't afford to buy her one. Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to get thee behind her, and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it's Chucky's sister. Along the way Pitch manages to get Santa stuck in a tree from whence he's rescued by Merlin! Merlin? You have got to be kidding me! This movie is one long HUH? from start to finish, and it'll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasn't spiked or something. This movie is like one long giant DT.\n",

      "\"Santa Claus\" is a jolly film about Santa helping out some kids, but it almost feels demonic watching it. Santa's jolly ho-ho-ho is replaces by an evil, devilish laugh that I'm sure has turned many kids off of Christmas. Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty. Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much more merry than Santa. Everything about this film, along with being downright bad, is so bizarre. The first 10 minutes are simply Santa playing the organ while kids sing to it. Santa seems to only deliver to 5 houses of kids in Mexico. The reindeer are wind up toys. I think parents are better off telling their little kids about where babies come from, than showing them this.

Instead of the usual elf toy makers, this Santa has apparently kidnapped kids from all across the globe and makes them sing a bit like characters from \"It's a Small World\"! I guess there are no child labor laws on the weird astral plane on which he lives. . I sure hope that all they do is sing and make toys. The Devil and his imps are actually kind of cute--like Hot Stuff from the Harvey Comics but with cool evil goatees! Somehow a poverty-stricken Mexican kid named Lupita, a group of jerky kids who want to mug Santa and some rich kid are key battlegrounds for the Devil and Santa!! So, if the Prince of Darkness can somehow make her steal and be bad, he'll 'win'--what, we don't really know! In fact, as they root her on, you get the impression that the film makers intend Santa to be Jesus. Santa meets with his friend, Merlin. He asks him to make him a special powder that makes people dream nice dreams. Considering how much Santa laughs in the film, I assume he must use this drug A LOT! He immediately goes to see a blacksmith who makes him a magic key that opens ALL doors. Pitch destroys Santa's stash of 'magic powder' and gets treed. Pitch then tries to steal the sleigh (which is pulled by creepy animatronic deer) Santa can't become invisible to avoid dogs and gets Treed. St. Nick's stuck up a tree?! Will St. Nick get down from the tree and get the monkey off his back or will the devils win? If you care, tune in and see. However, be warned that the film is bat-crap crazy! A Santa that kidnaps kids is just plain creep-tastic. It's a film you should NEVER show to kids but makes a great film to watch with friends so you can laugh at it from start to finish.\n",

The film, in fact, is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized Mexican horror outings. It was acquired for release in the U.S. by K. Gordon Murray. In a nutshell, the plot involves Satan's efforts to stall Santa Claus' Christmas Eve rendezvous with the Earth's children. There is, however, plenty more wackiness along the way: to begin with, our portly, white-bearded and chronically merry man-in-red lives in a celestial palace. The Wizard visits Merlin once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible. The Wizard's anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of Dr. Frankenstein in SON OF Dracula [1974]!! The Devil's antics to hold up St. Nick's delivery program, then, is perfectly puerile. Their tit-for-tat shenanigans resemble an old Laurel & Hardy routine more than anything! fillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra-large packages!), a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own. A trio of brats who, egged on once again by Satan, think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves.

      "I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared it's head like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show. At the time,I marveled that the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost \"pink and white\", so much had had to be changed. The film is kinda creepy! I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly entertained then, as I still am! It's amusing in a \"retarted-elf\" sort of way. By the way,the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74. By nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish)always makes them seem \"surreal\". This adds to the films inherent oddness. It is also pretty scary in that a \"mishevious demon\" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids \"evil\" Christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're hallucinating...without drugs. daydreaming! See this, Christmas lovers.\n",

      "Filmed in Low-Budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid, (\"A Touch of Pink\"), \"How She Move\" tells the tale of how important step-dancing is. Two actors that look like LL Cool J work in an auto shop in Toronto. They still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. There are a few other guys in this \"crew,\" including a token white dude. There are also two women in the movie - one resembles Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old \"Flip Wilson Show\" One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all of her tuition on a drug-addicted sibling. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, no doubt, is just plain no good. idently, this activity is very hard-core in the 'hood, and they are all practicing for the big \"Step Monster\" jam in Detroit. Since I was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue (perhaps some subtitles would have been useful, as in a Bergman film or that one music video by Snow), it's hard to explain what happens. I was \"moved\" by this movie, however. Moved to leave the movie. Why does a film which could have made a big impact on black audiences have to contain drug addiction, bad parents and a title that sounds like a first-grader saying the phrase, \"How she moves\"? The goal is to get the information to the U.S. as quickly as possible. It is hoped that the information will be released to the public in the coming days and weeks. The information will also be made available to the media and the public.\n",

Scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism. The film is boring, too, and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time. The final twenty minutes are a poor re-run of Scott's \"True Romance\" climax with Domino's gang going to meet two sets of feuding bad guys. This potentially exciting conflagration is totally botched by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically brave or experimental piece; it is a failure on every level. Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears into the background as the \"narrative\" progresses. abney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. Don't be fooled by this film's multi-layered, gimmick-ridden surface. It is still a turd no matter how hard you polish it.\n",

While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that I'm unable to buy it. FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out. Besides, what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder. In reality, they'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. The accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which is from Domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs. The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle. This combined with the awful, uneasy camera work makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie. The film is a waste of time. for the wasted effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of question.

Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new, wacky racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter. What does this have to do with the main plot? Nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors' fee of 300,000. Bounty hunters are stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes.

I don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it. There's a place for it. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colorful editing would be Fight Club. I understand there are many people who liked this movie. I guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it. Tony Scott please give me my time back.\n",

      "Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he's made after \"Crimson Tide\" seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today. And like other overblown Hollywood biopics (\"De-Lovely\" and \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\" for instance), chronicling the lives of pretentious, overrated, or outright shallow ciphers. \"Domino\" is a film that begins with little potential, and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With an already-distended running time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long. Scott's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony only draws attention to the film's sledgehammer cluelessness. Keira Knightley plays spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey. She accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade. Along the way, there are double-crosses, shootouts, media attention. Scott's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image, ghost it, or distort it in some way, he will. But all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot, characterization, and suspense the film has. Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical. \"Domino\" is utter, unmitigated trash. Whatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience, it is lost in a sea of migraine-inducing neon pretension a few minutes in.\n",

      "What of Domino did I hate over everything, and I mean everything, else? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter. Maybe it was sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character. The mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints. Nobody comes away from Domino with any sort credibility, absolutely nobody at all. It is a painful and misguided experience, taking inspiration from things like Natural Born Killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them. horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like Kiera Knightly. There are things you genuinely don't know how to react to, whether they're supposed to be funny or not. uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as 'tough' The film opens with the title card 'Based on a true story........sort of.' If this is supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director Tony Scott to bend and manipulate the story of Domino Harvey for his own unique purpose, then you're simply on another planet. Truth is, in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of' We are then thrust into action with Ed Mosbey (Rourke); Domino (Knightley) herself and would-be love interest Choco (Ramírez) During the scene, an American mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son's life to be spared. The film is painful to watch, excruciating even; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in Beverly Hills 90210. The immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads, a feeling of 'No, why are you doing this?' Domino is cast into Ed and Choco's gang, purely for her good looks. Christopher Walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of Robert Downey Jr's Natural Born Killers character. ; the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place? Does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up? If there is any 'feeling' between Choco and Domino, it exists on such a small, tiny, minimalist scale that you have to ask why it's even included. The film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up. Plus, there's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film's comedy runs SO dry, that it has to resort to comedy. When did we last laugh at \"Jerry! Jerry!\"? when we were, say, seven years old? I came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence. \"Jerry, Jerry!\" chant whilst people are on a popular American talk show.\n",

      "I haven't seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in quite a while. I'm a big fan of the \"old-school\" late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films, and I had been hearing that that \"style\" of films is making a bit of a come-back. The story follows a young, animalistic, resourceful and virtually unstoppable Thai hit-man with a somewhat vague history. Due to some bad-luck, he is quickly identified by a roguish copy and is quickly apprehended and captured. This state of affairs doesn't last long though, as the un-named assassin escapes and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly. A cat-and-mouse game between the police and the \"mad dog\" (as the police refer to him) ensues. Along the way, Mad Dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow-witted young woman. A bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation. DOG BITE DOG has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the \"good ol' days\", but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old-school classicks like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. don't want to give too much away. This film is far more \"emotional\" than it is exploitative. As we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides. There really are no clear-cut \"good\" and \"bad\" guys. There's pretty much nothing that I didn't like about this film. The acting is dead-on, the cinematography is sharp and well done, and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that isn't seen very often. Is this film is a typical characteristic of the older CATIII films. and others like it...) the \"rebirth\" of the CATIII film - not exactly, but it IS a very solid film that's absolutely worth checking out...9/10.

      "Despite being quite far removed from my expectations, I was thoroughly impressed by Dog Bite Dog. I essentially expected it to be a martial arts/action film in the standard Hong Kong action tradition, of which I am a devoted fan. I ended up getting something entirely different, which is not at all a bad thing. I was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film. The lead character, played by Edison Chen (who is really very good), becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than I ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes. The police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly. In fact, the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the movie. Dog Bite Dog has some very unique, and really quite courageous, ideas to present about the police force. So many films, especially Hong Kong action films I find, portray police in what is frankly a VERY ignorantly idealized light. Dog Bite Dog. certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film (unfortunately) Chen's character meets a girl he meets in the junk yard, which reveals a lot about his character. Documentary footage of Cambodian boys being made to fight to the death with their bare hands was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments. Dog Bite Dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography, all though it is unfortunately rather uneven. There were some moments that I found really striking, particularly in the last segment of the film, but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just OK. Another slight problem I had was with the pacing, which I also felt was uneven. I found a lot of the \"looking for a boat\" scenes to be to much. The action scenes are short and not too plentiful, but are truly powerful and effecting, particularly towards the end. The fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part, all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic. The true strength is the emotional content behind the fights. Dog Bite Dog is one of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind. There was something very human about all of them that I couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them, particularly Chen's girlfriend. I doubt most people will like the film as much as I did simply because I imagine that most people won't like or care about the characters in the same way. \"If you give it a chance. deeply moving and effecting film if you give It a chance\" \"It's a great film. It's a beautiful film. If you giveIt a chance, it's a wonderful film\"\n",

      "A Cambodian hit-man goes to Hong Kong to knock off the wife of a judge, who is also a lawyer. Turns out, the Judge made the arrangements for the hit- man, because she was divorcing the judge. This is a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many cops are killed, as the hit-man proves very very hard to track. The acting is exceptionally good, and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking. Along the way, the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump, finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man. He helps her, and saves her from the guy, and she persuades him to take her along. \"Dog Eat Dog\" definitely needs a more widespread release, including an R1 release for sure. The ending is pretty much unbelievable, and also a fitting end to all the action and violence. Yes, the violence is brutal at times, but this is a very no nonsense crime drama.\n",

      "Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge. Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless ruthless assassin. Dog Bite Dog has been likened to the classic Cat III films of the 90s. A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from Chen and Lee. Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy) Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang. There is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it. After all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies. The film might not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong excess, but it's still worth seeking out.\n",

      " Edison Chen did a fantastic, believable job as a Cambodian hit-man, born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring. In a role that had little dialogue, or at least a few lines in Cambodian/Thai, his performance is compelling. Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia, who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong, on the run from the cops. It's a grim, gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively, and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production. The story itself works on multiple levels, especially in the character studies of the hit-man, and the cop. On opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. The cop, with questionable tactics and attitudes, makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. The hit-man, we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei) Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end. If I should pick a favourite scene, then it must be the one in the market food centre. Listen out for the musical score too, and you're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs. The cop thriller genre is a genre that has been around for a long time. This is the latest in a long line of cop thrillers to hit the big screen. The film is based on the book \"The Killing\" by James Patterson, which was published in 1973.\n",

One of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn't enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles. And not once has it been his fiancée, Akane, who has fallen in love with Ranma. And thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series. The story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so... so... out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable... I can't even describe it to its fullest. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo... with every little problem the story throws at him he's doing his best just to survive half the time. His personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius. Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to ever live. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma's greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to Ranma)... and maybe one of the only people he can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault... is his lack of sense in direction! Check out the series if you haven't, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. The humor doesn't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. But either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10. CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of New York City for next week.

Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date. Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg. Boy, in turn does also transform into said thing. The movie's main attraction besides the violence and gore (like I haven't mentioned that enough already) are the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya who's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video-games is well known. subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came to their lives. \"Meatball Machine\" is \"Tetsuo The Iron Man\" mixed up with \"Alien\" all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode. Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film, necroborgs are A-movie class. The splatter genre is still alive and kicking. entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splattergenre is still live and kicking, says Tom Charity.

This is a review, so I'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion. Why aren't more films (especially American) more like Meatball Machine? , Meatball Machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring. Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema! In this film human bodies are host to Aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. Fight scenes!! Great Music!! Great point-of-view shots! Decent acting by the woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine. My wife walked in while I was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. This is not junk. This isn't just SPLATTERTER. splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). This is Art my friends. This is art my friends, this is Art. It's time to get back to the drawing board.\n",

      "Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him. All acting across the board is superb. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making. My grade 10 out of 10.

The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie made it what it is. , Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge, and Vertigo. Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, I believe they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar. Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score. Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.\n",

      "Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; playing the basis character for the story. Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time. With a great adaptation by David Self, the dialogue comes out seldomly, but yet very virtuous. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting. The events to follow, will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace his family's fate. The most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful photography. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen; and I watch a lot of films. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, entering Chicago is quite impressive. Sam Mendes made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. Before American Beauty, Mendes worked as a play director for the British Theater. With only a great cast and crew, the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film. The film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses. The photography, acting and story is phenominal. Sam Mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors (In a list of about twenty-five).\n",

      "I loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack. It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving. At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story. There was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling. The film is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary. I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time. He loved it - and the discussion.)\n",

      " ROAD TO PERDITION is the second film from director Sam Mendes. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD To PERdITION is a distant cousin to THE GodFATHER in terms of what it does. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie. What it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity. Only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom. This is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here. The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary. concerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme. Daniel Craig is the classic \"man you love to hate\", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father. Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie, I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here.\n",

Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).

      "Frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors. The opposite of perdition (being lost) is salvation (being saved) The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship. Rooney's son Connor is even more evil than the rest. He kills one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael witnessed it, he mistakenly kills Sullivan's other son in an attempt to silence witnesses. Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. As the movie ends, somewhat predictably, one character is saved and one is killed. Sullivan and Maguire pursues Rooney and his son. Tom Hanks steps out of character to play hit-man Sullivan convincingly. Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation. The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes, distinctive acting, and enveloping music and cinematography. Thomas Newman's lush, sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Copland-like arrangements. I give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film. was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y, the movie's only nod to political correctness.\n",

The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) and Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) Rooney is tied by blood to his own son, but tied by love and loyalty to Michael. Young Michael Jr. steals away in his father's car one night. Michael Sr. is on the run with his young son, pursued by contract killer Harlen \"The Reporter\" Maguire (Jude Law) The plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (9 nominations, 2 oscars for best cinematography) has given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career. rain pouring off fedoras, shots through mirrors (especially on swinging doors) tommy-gun flashes from out of the shadows, absent any sound. , but 77-year-old Paul Newman offers one of his best performances ever.

      "ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score. It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work. While listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Sam Mendes film is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes. I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent. Newman's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top. While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are excellent. Law will still have a long career as a leading actor. One wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn't decided to become James Bond. A role which heralds the end of an actors career.\n",

      "\"American Beauty\" doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done. For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins, and is simply wonderful to watch because of it. Normally squeaky-clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930's. He is also a professional hit-man to mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons. But after his eldest (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses his dad involved in a mob. , the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up. Soon, father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit-man (a menacing Jude Law) is waiting for them. Hanks is (*grits teeth*) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price. The cast is pretty much faultless. As is the cinematography and costumes which recreates the 30's with stunning effect. This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30's look was difficult to put down - but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit. The story is also a winner, offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain. Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire. The film is decidedly noir-ish, driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate. Mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut, a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch. It can feel a little slow in places, especially if you're used to masses of gun-play in movies. \"Road To Perdition\" may not be to everyone's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon. \"Road to Perditions\" is available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n",

In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivan is a hit-man who is now being hunted by his former partner. Sullivan's boss or ex-boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) loves him almost more than his own son, Sullivan's partner Connor (Daniel Craig) After a job done the wrong way because of Connor, the only witness to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who wasn't supposed to be there. So Connor tries to take out Sullivan's family, but only gets the wife and other son Peter. Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile. His loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town.

Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT, the Colonel's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life. The Colonel trains his son's fighting cock. The cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the Colonel and his asthmatic wife. But his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner, Agustin. Nogales, a paid government agent, offers to equal the Colonel's full pension. But, this is blood money; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals. With maximum dignity, the Colonel rejects Nogales' offer and walks away. olding wife, wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving. Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives, and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity. The Colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles.\n",

El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba is the latest in a long line of great Mexican movies. The film's characters, satirically represent classic characters found in Mexican society. by people like the Colonel, who wait for their pensions, but by more than the half of the Mexican population, who live in complete poverty. This movie, is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican society, and specially, ifyou want to watch a gorgeous movie, by one of Mexico's finest directors.\n",

I'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though. Great nude scenes! That lady's a fox. great nude scenes.

      "From wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout. A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch. Dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. Meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They don't seem to have any friends other than each other. Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as \"you know its a shame you're my sister\" Bo is crushed when Ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. -lines, Fred \"the hammer\" Williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes) All of these things are great, but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire.\n",

      "Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80's exploitation, hooray! The pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama. Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship. As kids they fled from Russia with their parents, but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy. A friendly smuggler took custody over them, however, and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers. When the actual plot lifts off, 20 years later, they're facing their ultimate quest. The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded. The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid. Most of the time you have no clue who's beating up who or for what cause. but it sure is a lot of fun to watch. The original French title translates itself as \"Life to Survive\", which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie. the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film.\n",

      "White Fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claimed it's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made. It's filled to the brim with action, sleaze and nudity. ously awkward dialogue, all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film. Ginty, the unusual looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR (and countless other low budget action turds) is amusing in the lead. The rest of the cast is also fun to watch, particularly the villains. It's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget. Also, when Ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys, he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering. . It's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic. The film was released in the UK in 1968. It was the first film to be released on Blu-ray and DVD.\n",

Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster. \"Dan in Real Life\" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. The rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to find a reason to laugh. \"Dan in Real Life\" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies.

      "If you're anything like me, smooth and single do not go together. You see someone you like, rare enough as that can be, and you want to say something but you don't. You stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life. DAN IN REAL LIFE, the new comedy from director Peter Hedges, is a must-see. It will reach inside you and will make you think about things you've never done before. The Dan from the title is Dan Burns, an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced, fulfilling and morally uplifting life. Four years or so before the film opens on Dan waking up to his day, he lost his wife and love of his life. After that tragedy, Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone. , Dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again. That is, until he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a book and tackle shop in Connecticut on a quiet morning. There is only one problem really. She is already seeing someone. With so many family members to deal with (Jack Mahoney and Dianne Wiest are at the helm), DAN IN REAL LIFE does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time. While the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for Dan, Hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract. It is a pleasure to watch Steve Carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes. He is charismatic, charming and obviously a sharp humorist. As Dan, he is also self-deprecating, awkward and scared. Dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd. Carell gives Dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time. I don't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved. DAN IN REAL LIFE knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished. It also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen.\n",

Nowadays we are slaves to images! To impressions! I went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression, the wrong expectations, and at the end I felt how superficial I could be! Sidney believes that just because he got on TV thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity. This is the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves. Above this, I believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this. Even the saints of any religion are images, ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life. Even they were not for real ... they became 'for real' after they died and we looked back at them. And that's the catch: we need our saints. . And television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings. We desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves.

      "Simon Pegg plays the part of Sidney Young, a young entertainment writer. He has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine. The movie is based on the very bizarre career of Toby Young, who also ran a small magazine in Britain. Jeff Bridges plays the chief editor of Sharp's Magazine in the movie. He offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of Young. Young is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication. He is positively beaming on his first day. Much of the comedy in the movie is derived from Young's misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous. Sidney's reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture. Complicating matters are two very different women. There is a charming, regular girl at the magazine named Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) and a stunning model named Sophie (Megan Fox) Sidney's endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for Sophie. Alison is a regular girl, not very interesting or attractive, but Dunst's performance makes her a real person. A relationship with her would have all the reality of a Britney Spears marriage. Despite how obvious this is, we also feel Sidney's pain in not pursuing her (I felt it, anyway). Danny Huston, for example, gives us a great performance as Alison's other love interest, who pays homage to The Big Lebowski. Buying Absolute and Kahlua here in China costs the equivalent of about $350, but my kitchen is never without them. \"He's a rising star, it will be interesting to see what else he can do. He's a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him\"\n",

Besides I'd say the movie isn't able to keep a high level. Until now I've never seen Pegg any different. Still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary. Fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds. The film is a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages, a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending.

Its not one of those \"gross out\" comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative. Hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with Pegg. His first jab at the lead role was David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboy Run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike. His second try is this movie, got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office. I, for one still haven't lost faith in him and I'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory. The spark that I saw in Interview with the Vampire is still lost.

After a nuclear war, the Earth(or \"Biosphere Prime\")'s ecosystem was destroyed. The survivors we're forced to escape into space, where the conflict continued. Once the planets were all abandoned, people began to live in MegaZones - cities inside of spaceships. -esque illusion, they were made to believe they we're back on earth, in the most peaceful time in recent memory... The 1980s. When young Shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle, it leads him to find out more than he's supposed to know. The Garland(a bike which becomes a mech), a weapon from the 2400's, aids Shogo in his escape from the pursuing military. As more and more is discovered about the MegaZone, the war comes closer to home. Emotions run high in this movie, moreso than The Matrix. What starts off as an uber-happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality. There really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy. . It may just choke you up towards the end... I know it did me. The artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood, there's also an erotic sex scene. MegaZone 23 is considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time. The ADVision DVD is incredible, and does the movie justice, and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released. It's an essential in any anime fan's collection. Heck, even my mother enjoyed it. It's a must-have for all anime fans, even if you're not a fan of anime.\n",

      "This series premiered on the cable TV station \"Comedy Central\" in the United States. It was chopped to death, and shown out of sequence. Luckily, at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC. Thank goodness because I got to see \"The League of Gentlemen\" in order. \"The League of Gentlemen\" though are one step beyond. It's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills, it goes deeper and much, much, darker. If that is not your thing, don't watch. There's a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end. Watch it in order. See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. No one and nothing is out of bounds.

The format of the show is a lot like LITTLE Britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this hellish town. This is NOT a show for kids, the easily offended or normal people and that's probably why I liked it. However, you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the full. .

      "The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. So much so, it paved the way for more Comedies of its ilk. Many have copied the style, but have never succeeded. Other oddities include: the Denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; Hillary Briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat. Owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence. Despite being a comedy at heart, The League of Gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material. Even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and characters such as Pauline and Geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. The third series takes a different route, instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character. Each storyline leads to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van. Although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they're certainly signs to how inventive The League of Gentlemen can be.\n",

      "This is probably the best television show I've ever seen. I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago. At the time I was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order. I am SO GLAD I rediscovered it! Little Britain has nothing on LoG! (No offense, Matt & David....Love you)! This is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius. Serial murder, implied cannibalism.....you name it and it's probably found in the show. The location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of Royston Vasey.....You'll Never Leave! I think my favorite character would have to be Tubbs, but each character as portrayed has it's own \"charm\" My least favorite was Papa Lazarous, that was until he re-surfaced in series three (clever and wholly unexpected)! T stop watching. This is not for those with weak stomachs, kids, conservatives or Grandma (unless you've got one saucy granny)! I have always loved British TV, particularly comedies, from Monty Python to Benny Hill, Red Dwarf to Keeping Up Appearances, Absolutely Fabulous and the British originals Coupling and The Office. Nothing, NOTHING on US TV has ever come close to this level of entertainment. Even our cable channels don't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem. Thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the \"across the pond\" that redeem the entire medium every decade or so. Basic cable here in the US has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently \"crossing lines\" \"According to Jim\" has been on the air for 10 years??? 10 YEARS?? Anyway... Watch this show, get it on DVD, do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well! You've never seen anything like it. There are three specials that I have not watched yet....I'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits. 'll watch them, even if I have to chain him up and paint him with Excrement. Note that series three departs from one and two....the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters. The laugh track is gone (thank bloody hell) and the theme is more band and less orchestra. In 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight-gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close-up facial expression. Brilliant, confident and absolutely demented. You will want to re-watch it again and again.\n",

Jermy Dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend, with actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, and Reece Shearsmith. Royston Vasey is a sinister small town in England's idyllic countryside, where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers. The unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center. A farmer uses real people as scarecrows; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to food to hook people on. By themselves, the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters. The make up and prosthetics are so good I actually thought I watching a lot more actors on the show than there were. It's also great acting: the way they change their voices and their body movement, the really become other people. -up barging into someone's house and kidnapping women to be his wives.

      "A fantastic show and an unrealized classic; The League of Gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times. A dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired, formulaic approach of it's inferior, yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor, Little Britain. The sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations. What really sets the show apart from it's rivals, is it's approach to telling us it's story. Rather than serve us re-hashed sketches, barely distinguishable from the next, here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys. Unlike other current shows like The Catherine Tate Show or more importantly Little Britain, the League both know when a character has run it's course, and have the opportunity to deal with that. Several fan favorite's who could have easily been kept on to entertain further, bowed out before the series came to a close. The writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence. All four members of the League have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations. This awareness has also meant The League of Gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution, not usually seen in a show of this nature. The third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style, as well as a real treat for fans who've already seen the first two. Like the Christmas special, they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative, unlike the more sketch-based previous series' that binded together various sets of sketches into a series' long story arc. It might take a little trying to get into the change in style, but it's definitely worth it, and in my opinion, the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series. The show's not without it's drawbacks, and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place, but for the most part, the genius writing, dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters (that are often all too close to real life) make the show great. ) make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent, catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame. This is a great example of what comedy is all about.\n",

The military father doesn't like the bird, so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him manners, etc., while traveling across the country to find Paulie's owner. A beautiful mixture of flute, digital base, and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy. The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more.

Marie's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable, and thought Paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter's mental health. Paulie is the best family movie I have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed. Ever. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie, with the whole family. No sleeping. I promise.\n",

      "I approach films about talking animals with care. For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. It manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising. Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha. Paulie began his life as a baby in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl with a stutter. When Marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America. Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. Jay Mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck. , but he is also naive in his way. Because he's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. When he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie. Only for those promises to be broken time and again. Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking. The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. The sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over. The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. Paulie even gets to have a romance. Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by Mohr as well) The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course they do find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes. A minor gem. A minor gem, but a minor gem at the same time. It's a gem, and a gem at that. A gem, a gems, a gem and a gems.\n",

The animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one.

      "I didn't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Seven Samaurai\" However, the IMDb voter leans to the geeky, and \"Paulie\" doesn't qualify for that. Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child. Tony Shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans. The movie has the best of many films: buddy road-trip, con-games, hero as friendly party-animal. Disney-like humor for young and old. Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances in the film. I have always found Jay Mohr to be a bit slimy, and his on-screen role fits that as well. Put Parrot and anti-Parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own. \"Paulie\" is a perfect candidate for a movie that is neither insulting nor boring for either. I will, however, admit that a happy moment colors my review of \"Paulie.\" I was on a road-trip during a major heat-wave. It's a sleeper film you won't regret watching. how well this movie was made. How well it was made is a major factor in why it's so popular. It's a film you'll never regret watching, regardless of your political views.\n",

She forgets one joke in the middle of telling it but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical. Midler brings the house down near the end with \"Stay with Me, Baby\" from THE ROSE and her only #1 hit record, \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" from BEACHES.\n",

      "'Presque Rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Eschewing both stereotypes and preaching, it's a wonderfully naturalistic film. If anything it's almost too realistic, as there's little in the way of conventional plot, just scenes from a life. Simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme. Worth a watch. The film was directed by Michael Haneke and shot in black-and-white.\n",

      "\"Come Undone\" appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum. The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended. It is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him. Sebastien Lifshitz, the director of the film, has told his story from Mathieu's viewpoint. Most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film. There are hints that are not obvious, as one can see, in retrospect. Cedric, the handsome young local, pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him. We realize how different both young men are by the way Cedric tells Mathieu's family how he feels school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him. Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson, the hard way. He goes on to an uncertain life with Cedric and attempts to take his own life. We watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul. Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. This is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level. The last scene at the beach, when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling in the sand, has a hopeful sign that things will be better. , first with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and with losing Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has been seen on other important French films, is equally good, as the shallow Cedric . \"Come Undone\" will divide opinions, the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story.\n",

      "'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz. By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths. Mathieu (handsome and gifted Jérémie Elkaïm) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (Dominique Reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness. It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film. While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel Mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion. The youth Cédric follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction. The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love. The enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes. ian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one. In a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu. is excited by the beauty of the history and space while Cédric. is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking. Their moments of joy are disrupted by CÉdric's admission of infidelity and Mathieu's inability to cope with that issue. After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now is powerful. Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers. Lifshitz is a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative. In French with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.\n",

      "Maybe \"Presque Rien\" is not the best movie ever made... But it is better than many of you have said. I still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one. European movies are less narrative, but makes you think much and feel. This movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys. Summer Holidays and beach are only a background. Summertime in Pornichet, when they meet and love. Mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. Presque Rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life. Mathieu come back to Pornichet, in winter, alone.. to think about how his life have changed. This is not a funny movie. Mathieu only wants to go away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness. But what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought. He is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide. ? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Is all about feelings... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness... I, as many others, feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu, and that is what director wanted to do. For me, the best homo-themed movie ever.\n",

      "Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale of love, disaster and possible redemption. The core story is of Mathieu, 18, a solitary, introverted boy who meets Cédric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on holiday. Cédric cheats on Mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. He survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met. The intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. The three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded. Both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it's a delight to see Stéphane Rideau used to his full potential. Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could. The themes touched upon are almost classic in French cinema. Mathieu's suicide attempt points to all of these and, indeed, to one of the key scenes in the film. In trying to understand why Mathieu attempted to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had ever cheated on him \"Non enfin, oui une fois, mais ce n'était rien\" (No well, yes once, but it was nothing) The film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest. We get to see Cédric's slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life. But here the story ends: A teenage passion, over within the year, another perhaps beginning. \"Almost Nothing\" was it? Almost Nothing? Certainly not when you're living it. Was it? \"Almost Nothing?\" \"Almost nothing\" is not what you think it is.\n",

      "I agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog. The movie is non-linear and that's a hallmark of European film-making as opposed to the linear narrative form that Hollywood favors. It evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind. 's true or not. Many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations. To those viewers, I don't think there is much I can say to change their opinions. For others who have yet to see the film, DO expect to be challenged and DON'T expect the film to supply all the answers. Yes, lots of things are left unsaid or not shown, and lots of situations are left unexplored. But isn't that what life is like? A lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends/loved ones unless you confront them. \"I think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off, mentality fragile by that scene w/ the dead bird\" \"Maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him\" \"I don't know, maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it\" There is one conversation between the doctor and Cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt. Is that the only reason, we don't know, there are probably others, all mixed up together. I don't think so, for this movie. The ending is really rather hopeful and sweet. I was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end. I have two complaints for the DVD. One is the sound. It's very soft. Most foreign movie DVDs not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately. The other is that the subtitles can't be turn off; they stay on the screen. or outdoor crowd scene, it became too loud.\n",

These two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper connection was evident. This was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. Though many scenes seem superfluous, I rate it nine out of ten. Subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my French is \"presque rien\"\n",

      "I found this film the first time when I was searching for some works in witch Stéphane Rideau had participate, still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful «Les roseaux sauvages» (in Portuguese, Juncos Silvestres) The story is about two guys, the kind of «boy «boy». The director Sébastien Lifshitz deliciously amazes us, earning a nomination by the Cannes festival in 2000. Mathieu (Jérémie Elkaïm) and Cédric (Stéphane Rideau), who meet during the summer vacations. In a land far from where he lives, Mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister. There he meets a local, with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship. The best of the film is the best of France: the fervent passion, the hot and excited rationalism, the brownish beauty, the simple and natural acceptance made by the families. Exemplar in directing, in the amorous sequence, in an intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his sexuality and great love. The sex is not avoided nor exploited, it is treated as it is, with no exhibitionist intention. In virtue of pure talent, this is a work of drama of uncommon quality, without cheap sentimentalism. It is well worthy being seen, especially by those who adore French movies. A movie witch, in my opinion, deserves an 8-9. between tens of stars, greased with brilliantine. A movie witch is a movie witch (and I'm not just saying that to make a point)\n",

      "A lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with Cedric (the gorgeous Stephane Rideau). Quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. , does something that ends him up in the hospital. What is it--we're never told! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him. Why? We're not told. Then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end. No explanation. It's clear Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu is living in the same town so... There is full frontal male nudity, lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great. Most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes. This one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other. So, a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing--especially for Rideau's nude scenes. If you like good-looking nude young men, you'll like this film. The film is rated PG-13.\n",

      "This is an unusual Laurel & Hardy comedy with something of a split personality. At times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short. The boys' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film's disparate elements into an entertaining whole. line: a wildly over-the-top parody of Mad Scientist scenarios. This marks a rare venture into sci-fi territory for L&H. Stan & Ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the Professor's home. \" portion of the film consists of characteristic (but first-rate) slapstick involving the chimney, the roof, shovels, and a number of unfortunate mishaps. The highlight comes when Ollie plummets through the Chimney, lands in the fireplace, and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision, one by one. For fans of the team this movie is a feast. The slapstick stuff is great fun, but it's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat. Lucien Littlefield is terrific as the professor, delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee. Sam Adams is a stitch in the less showy part of the film. This is a prime example of what made Laurel & Hardy so popular in their day. A rare occasion from this period that a Roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits. Mood music might have enhanced the proceedings, but no matter; this is a highly enjoyable comedy.\n",

      "In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&H short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . Guess what happens next ? That`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues . Ollie for example is very unlikable , he`s arrogant , he’s rude , and not only to Stan look at the way he addresses the servant with \" HEY YOU \" and takes a childish huff. DIRTY WORK also lacks the reportary regulars of the other L&H shorts like Finlayson , Long , Busch and Housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie. Having said that this is still a good short mainly down to Stan. Many jokes/plots from L&H feature fish and this is another one. This is a great example of how fish are used in the show. It's a great way to introduce fish to a new audience.\n",

      "Professor Noodle (Lucien Littlefield) is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula, with the ability to reverse ageing, after twenty years. Ollie and Stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job, and very quickly Ollies wants to get away from Stan making mistakes. After breaking an extension, Stan gets a replacement, a loaded gun, from off the wall, and of course it fires the brush off. Stan goes up to have a look, and Ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. Ollie and Stan clean up the mess after the fireplace is hit by bricks. Ollie asks \"Can't you do anything right?\" and Stan replies \"I have nothing to say\" The boys get distracted by a painting on the wall, and the ashes end up down Ollies. Professor Noodle finishes his formula, and does a final test on a duck, with a drop in a tank of water, changing it into a duckling. Also shows the boys his success, turning the duckling into an egg, and he next proposes to use a human subject, i.e. his butler. While he's gone, the boys decide to test the formula for themselves, but Ollie ends up being knocked by Stan into the water tank with all the formula. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film. Very good!\n",

Films such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest as you see the boys working. There is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie. It seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. While this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough.

      "I last night saw the movie BUG at the Florida Film Festival and let me say it was a real treat. The Directors were there and they did a Q&A afterwards. The movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot. This movie has a lot of laughs, Lots! and there are many actors which you will recognize. The main actors who stood out in the film for me were: Jamie Kennedy (from his comedy show the Jamie Kennedy Experiment, playing a fortune cookie writer); John Carroll Lynch (who plays Drew's cross dressing brother on the Drew Carey show) playing the animal loving guy who just can't get it right. There is one line to him, some funny, some sad, and some ridiculous. The funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father, whom he heard earlier in the day yell out `MotherF*****', while in the classroom. Another extremely funny and surreal scene is when Trudie Styler (Mrs. Sting herself) and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show. The film was shot in less than a month with a budget of just about $1 million. Director Phil Hay and screenwriters Matt Manfredi have achieved a film that is great, funny and endearing.\n",

It was actually well-researched, and I can only assume it was written by someone who's gone through a similar experience, because it had all the little details. The characters were quite well-drawn, and the performances by Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great. Her mother wasn't completely clueless - too often on television they'll take an issue that EVERYONE has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who don't. It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she didn't see the signs. The scenes where Beth was throwing up weren't OVERLY melodramatic. The ending headed back to the TV movie territory we know and don't particularly love. The scene where Beth tells her mother she's bulimic would've made me cry if there hadn't been other people in the room. \"You, too, can cure your child's eating disorder, if you have lots and lots of money\" And can I just say again that I really like Mare Winningham.

      "This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in, effected by, or suffering from an eating disorder. It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl. The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today, Alison Lohman. Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother, and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman's. Together, they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another. This film is really an astonishing achievement, and director K. K. compulsive disorder. The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people. But even if you like nature films best, this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge.

Even the \"evil\" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics. the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children.

The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily. Characters contemplate on why they're in the Ice Age. Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas. There is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age. old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties.

      " cartoons can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story') There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury him. It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents. Some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. see, but good for a fun hour or so. 7/10. 7.5 out of 10. 6.5/10, 6.0 out of 8. 6/10 out of 9.\n",

      "Zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making. It is a sequel to Fulci's hit Zombi 2. Fulci himself starting to not care about the production. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help. Zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie fare. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it unleashing a plague, and zombie run amok. The scientists want to create an antidote, while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice. I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film, but it veered off in a weird direction, presumably when Mattei came on board. Besides ripping off other zombie flicks, this was very reminiscent of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news with, \"When you see the men in white suits & gas masks, Run to them for Help\" razies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is killed by mistake. My favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station. He was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl. , the scientists asks, \"Don't you think that once the ash is in the air, it will fall to the ground, and contaminate everything?\" To which the Sargeant boldly replies, \"Now you're talking science fiction.\" He also continues to mention the \"Science Fiction\" told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.

      "Although it's not as creepy as it's cult classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2) I actually like this one better. This is because of it's faster pace, better settings, and cool 80's soundtrack. It's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci. It was made pretty well but it definitely has it's share of cheesiness. There's even a flying zombie head! How rad is that? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. Also check out Zombi 4.\n",

      "A terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon, and in the process of trying to escape, he is infected. Soldiers are able to retrieve the case, but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out. Unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation, and if you've seen Return of the Living Dead, you know what happens next. There's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible. They're in the water, the rafters of houses, hiding in trees, and for some reason, they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush. There's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator. Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie. It's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers, and watch it with some like minded friends. I give it an 8/10, just because of sheer enjoyment.\n",

      "Every single film in the Zombi-\"series\" delivers great fun, nasty gore and gratuitous shocks. This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project, who had to elaborate further on his \"Zombi 2\" success. It ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas. Every ingenious idea from George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" and \"The Crazies\" is shamelessly repeated here. The acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at. Yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything! This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's \"Nightmare City\". Truly Bad...but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations. The infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it's made up to be. The film was released in the U.S. on September 14. It was released to negative reviews. The film is a box office success. It has been praised by critics and fans alike.\n",

If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it. If you're watching it on DVD, you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score. That's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer. There is only one loop in the U.S. that still exists which is long enough to loop. That loop is in the state of New Jersey. The loop was created in the early 1990s. It is the longest loop of its kind.\n",

Being a soft-core film, that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects. The script is okay, and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 AM watching this not to notice too many plot holes. The cinematography is badly lit, with everything looking grainy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying. The sex scenes aren't hot they're sleazy, shot in that porno style. . I'm not trying to be rude or mean here, but they all have that breast implants and a burned out/weathered look. Even the title, \"Deviant Obsession\", sounds like a Hardcore flick. Not that I don't have anything against porn - in fact I love it. But I want my soft-core and my hard-core separate. Hollywood's prude stance on sex has changed. Now they just make hard-core films without the hard- core sex. Kill. Kill Kill is out now on Blu-ray and DVD.\n",

Hadn't been seen in years. Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing. He goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, he's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair. Randolph Scott's original home studio was Paramount, it was where his first studio contract was with. Albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for Paramount and they gave him a good one. Barbara's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda. GOP had high hopes of winning the White House that year too, but things went awry. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot. My guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to.\n",

      "Randolph Scott is heading into Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the stage is held up. A nice lady on board is concealing $10,000 for her and her brother's business. . And, it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother. Not surprisingly, this is NOT the end of the problems---just the beginning. This one shows Scott as a bit more headstrong man. All too often in his films he's the last one to suggest violence, but in this film he's quick to suggest a lynching. What a surprise to see him as such a hot-head--though in most other ways, he's same old Scott you'd expect. Despite this very typical plot, it's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time. There are two weird scenes in the film. First, late in the movie, there is a fist fight between Scott and the uncle's #1 henchman, Lon Chaney, Jr. In it, Chaney smokes as he fights--something I never saw before. Second, get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip. now THAT was one impossible feat! \"I've never been able to do anything like that before,\" he said. \"It's been a long time since I've done something like that,\" he added.\n",

      "It begins with several of the principles on a stage run to Albuquerque. Gabby Hayes(Juke, sounds like Duke) is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general. He then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of Samson. Randy soon becomes a hero when he rescues a little girl from the runaway stage. It's too bad he wasn't in more of the better Randoph Scott westerns to help lighten up Randy's usual iron-jawed demeanor. As his rival's prospects rise, uncle John decides to plant an informant(Barbara Britton, as Letty Tyler) in the Wallace office. After he learns that uncle John was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor, Celia Wallace, and the associated murder, he decides to work for Celia and her brother Ted. Randy was in Letty's apartment when the fire was discovered. He confronted her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle John. This puts him and Letty in the dog house with Celia(his apparent beau) and Ted(who hopes to woo Letty) The plot is well constructed and executed, with complicated relationships between the principles. Uncle John tries once again to sabotage their ore run, and when that fails, there is a general shootout in town. At least, Randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice. It seems odd that Barbara Britton, the \"bad\" girl, gets top female billing over Catherine Craig, Randy's love interest. The presence of Hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women, as well as little Myrtle, much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival. Without apparent family to help support him, he can't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town. On the other hand, from his conversations, he probably achieved his status as the town \"boss\" before becoming wheelchair-bound.\n",

I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting.

      "'Capital City' fans rejoice! This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I've recently got my copy. Although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick' trading floor characters 'CAPITAL CITY' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line. Wendy's dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old-fashioned senior management of Shane Longman. I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by Wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit' Peter Longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father. The main interest in the series, I believe, stems from the simmering romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge's Declan and the cool self-assured blonde haired German trader Michelle Hauptmann. Viewers continually wondered if the situation between these two colleagues would develop. Looking forward to browsing through this title, and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away. The pair undoubted have. the close friendship/fondness that they undoubtedly have.\n",

Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice-acting. My all-time favorite, the Penguin, is here. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin's voice. The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a Bane who's much much more. than I was expecting. The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie.

      "The Mystery of Batwoman is based on the Batman cartoons. While the overall story is good I'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this. I was sort of disappointment that they didn't make the cast of credits into a movie. 75 minutes is way too short for any movie. The secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie, sort of midway, and becomes anti-climatic afterward. Some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid. I didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes, it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is Batman. We should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with Bruce Wayne. Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better. I recommend anyone who's a Batman fan to watch it. It has good storyline, universal appeal and even great acting to top it off. I just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making Batwoman stay. I want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story. I can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older.

      "Although it was 5 years after the series ended and WB was currently working on Justice League, this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library. Kevin Conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection. I was blown away by the Batwoman character, her look, her costume (which I assumed inspired Bruce Wayne to create the costume on Batman Beyond) This movie keeps you guessing who Batwoman is all the way through. Barbara Gordon makes a cameo appearance and I think the writers were trying to hint that Bruce and Barbara had something going on between them. Of the three suspects for Batwoman, my favorite is Kathy Duquesne, who looks an awful lot like Halle Berry. Kelly Ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. When it comes to the villains, I'm glad the Penguin was one of them. I did not like the fact that they replaced Paul Williams with David Ogden Stiers. Kevin Michael Richardson, who voices Carlton Duquesne is now the voice of the Joker in \"The Batman\" series. Rupert Thorne looks like revamped since he didn't show up in the Gotham Knights episodes. The late John Vernon will be missed. The musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb. I wish that was on a soundtrack and I especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented Cherie in the Iceberg Lounge along with her song, Betcha Neva. could have used Two Face, Riddler, or the scary new version of the Scarecrow. I would at least recommend renting this DVD first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie, but personally, it's well worth the purchase. I give Mystery of the Batwoman a 9.\n",

      "It aired on TV yesterday, so I decided to check it out. This was one of the last Bruce Timm/Paul Dini DTV projects related to their old 1992 Batman the Animated Series. Story of this new Batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as Batwoman. For an animated movie, it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone, which is good. The complete redesign of the Penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated Mob Boss we're used to seeing in the comics. Despite running for some very short 80 minutes, it manages to make a pretty good(and complex) storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action. Kevin Conroy still shines as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Nightwing is nowhere to be found. , and I'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne don't click as a couple, even though is just referenced, Tim Drake(aka Robin) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank, I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman character design. Bruce Wayne seems a bit awkward, those blue eyes make him look more like Clark. Overall, a good Batman animated movie, worth at least a rental. Rupert Throne does very little more then hang out with the Penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone. Count how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised.\n",

      "Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman straight to video/DVD movie to be released. The movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as 'Mask of the Phantasm,' 'Sub-Zero,' or 'Return of the Joker' The main reason being is that it doesn't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did. There is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a 'tragic' character (as Mr. Freeze or Phantasm were). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff' and dull. The action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments. If the Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie would have been better than 'Return of the Joker' in my book. As it is now, it's in 4th (out of 4) The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman films, but it's still good nonetheless. I do recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. But just remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies.\n",

It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back. The music was alright.

      "Let me be the first non Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and I watched it to the end. It's one of those \"drama of life\" films, as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive. I yearned for something like The Interview, or at least some matrix villain element. 's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you, but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close. The \"smart\" American Beauty sound-alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack, but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film. I guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie. and it didn't seem attractive as a story. It's a good movie if you're in the mood for it, but it's not a good story.\n",

      "Sensitive film does lack brilliance and, to some degree, narrative structure, but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed. However, the narrative structure point is debatable. While it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes, I'm sceptical as to whether this feel *needs* a \"narrative structure\" that is definite and detectable.  PEACHES is, in some ways, much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT. It's certainly very different to Monahan's first feature - THE INTERVIEW! I'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added to the story. They certainly rammed home the compromised and compromised. On a second viewing, I can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature. But I'm not sure how distinct these 'categories' are anymore, or even if we should be making that distinction. In any case, I do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark efforts. The performances are all good, but I did come to the realisation that the main reason I was enjoying the film was because it fit the \"Australian\" genre, without necessarily adding anything...and I can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person *NOT* to like it! Indeed, it wasn't until Lung enters the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really began. I haven't deleted my initial post on this film, because I'm all too aware of the Orwellian overtones of such an act. But I would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6.5. Is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story? The Human Touch, Three DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS are up for the top prize. The winner will be announced at the end of the month.

Your obvious dislike of the TV industry (\" Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background\") is confusing. particularly as you are having such \"a great time\" working in TV. I think Peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested, and most of my friends as well, from start to finish. It is far from flawless yet I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years. Who knows, with a few more viewings (there's so much to think about), it might just be just be a good TV idea. \"Somersault\" and \"Three Dollars\" had their moments-surreal, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues. But as for sheer entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie goer and me, it was very ordinary if not boring. there with classics like \"The Year My Voice Broke\", \"The Devil's Playground\".

      "Peaches is truly a marvelous film. I write this to refute a review from someone called 'Auscrit', that has appeared on this site. For me it works on every level and I have now seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity. Auscrit' to make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is no good simply does not 'get' the film. Or more particularly does not want to get it. Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Your average punter, I have found just does not write comments like that. SS is a film about nothing, that could have been told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety. Peaches in comparison is a master piece. I cannot wait to what Monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. If Auscrit. not win all at this years AFI's and IF awards, then it is a rigged game. As for Auscriter, please find something more constructive do with your time.\n",

      "TEARS OF KALI is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film. The film is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch. India-based Taylor-Erikkson cult group, that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's \"inner demons\" The film is told \"anthology-style\", with a short but memorable and \"eye-opening\" intro sequence, and then proceeding into the three stories. A journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the Taylor-Erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head. The closing story (KALI) revolves around a quack \"faith-healer\" and his assistant who perform \"miracles\" for a fee. When the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her, the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host. My biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue. The dubbing is sub-par and I would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. Some reviewers have said the acting is poor, which I don't necessarily agree with. The gore FX are very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors. Not as rough as some of the more \"extreme\" gore films out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare. I found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense. Although flawed in some fundamental ways, I still think TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most \"underground\" horror viewers. are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the likes of which I haven't come across in a while. Definitely Recommended - 8.5/10\n",

      "This is a trio of tales, \"Shakti\", \"Devi\", and \"Kali\", about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the Taylor-Eriksson group. Shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed.  Devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to \"jump out of his skin\" Kali tells the story of a healer, who attempts to \"heal\" a woman who was a part of a commune. Kali is probably the best of the three segments. All three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you're never really sure what to expect. This has a sort of low-budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout. I watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the film. \"I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot\" \"When the real scares (and gore) came it hit pretty hard\" \"A good little find, this one, I'd give it 8 out of 10\"\n",

      "Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece. An anthology horror, it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor-Eriksson Group, a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge. , with some pretty nasty gore at times. Its an interesting set up as these things go, but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror. Bad things have been unleashed. Lars Eriksson is seen healing or comforting a patient in a mental hospital. The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance. There are also references to folk in minuscule roles, extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions. There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within, it is a film about death, suffering and possible redemption too. Writer/director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film. The soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John is pretty chilling too. Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good. The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer. The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost. The film is well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think. It falls short of its possible brilliance, but is still worth a watch. The film is directed by Michael Hirst, who is also responsible for The Matrix.\n",

This movie is the 1970's version of Toy Story, pretty much down to a key, only this was a thousand times scarier, Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children. On Marcella's birthday, a new doll, Babette, arrives from Paris, France to the United States of America. Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone. Out in the world outside the nursery, the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely. He begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking, runs over the edge. The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette and believe me, it just gets weirder from this point on. The Greedy is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full. This certainly wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, I just don't know who to recommend it too. the writers and animators put their heart into it, you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure. \"A strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs\" \"A river that is eating everything, a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs, a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother\"\n",

The french doll has a very uptight french accent, the evil Hitler-esquire king Kookoo (whos got hair that resembles Simpson's Sideshow Bob) plays his role very well, and the sorrow old black man voice for Camel works perfectly. Why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones? Music: 10 - Nothing short of perfection here. Joe Raposo of \"Sesame Street\" fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well. A lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there's no telling WHO the other dolls and toys were. Between this and Unico i'd have to say there's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to. Mainly the scary parts. Outside of the South Park movie and some Disney films there's almost no animated musicals. HS copies are probably all stretched out by now. The DVD version is sold on Ebay all the time and it'll definitely be something you'll watch more than once. If anything get it for the nostalgia purposes. The effects in this seem like a lot of other acid-trip cartoons from the 70's. It wasn't easy to find but it'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of DVDs and videos forever.\n",

The animation shines on the bring us the Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-Knees, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end. The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many songs. It continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them. There are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) including \"I Look, And What Do I See?\" No Girl's Toy\", \"Blue\" (though they didn't need to make him sing it twice), \"I Never Get Enough\", \"Because I Love You\" and maybe \"I'm Home.\" The others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to.\n",

      "This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. It doesn't claim to be anything else or anything grander. People who deride it as something that fell short of a promise aren't seeing the whole picture- literally. The movie starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut, and Turandot but also sings popular music such as \"I left my heart\" The story isn't that bad. It was built for Pavarotti so of course it's not going to be something that's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer. It's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian:)) played by Kathryn Harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction. voice from fear. He offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts. They embark on an affair, she knowing he's married & promising not to fall in love with him. Despite all that, they fall inLove (thus the song, \"IF we were in love\") Pavarotti isn't an actor, so if you're expecting a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance, YOU are deluded, not Pavarotti. What he is is cute, charming & charismatic. He is having fun himself, and if you can just let yourself have fun too, it's not so bad. Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi-uptight woman. Eddie Albert does his usual good job as Fini's manager. There are several \"themselves\" cameos by real conductors, singers, etc. If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a \"little fling\" just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is.\n",

Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti, they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable; I don't agree. Enormously talented people can be both self-centered and charming. Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other. The ending scenes from Puccini's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there. a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities.\n",

      "The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina, as the DeLaRua administration was ending. The country was in turmoil after the economy had flourished earlier in the 1990s, under the artificially climate President Menen created. The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired because the collapse of the economy. The other story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew, interviewing for a job in a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle he gets the job. Santamarina, who is a clean man, has to resort to take showers wherever he can. He chooses a ladies' room in one of the subway stations. When the attendant, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances. Daniel, who has met the gorgeous Laura at work, begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker. Ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions, feels a passion for Laura, but he realizes what Estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him. Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, has collaborated with Mr. Burman before to surprising results. He is not 'movie star pretty', yet, he is not a movie star pretty. The nuances of the screen play make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of the country. . This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon. Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela. Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema. The director is known for his work in Argentina, particularly in the Buenos Aires area. The film was released in Argentina on September 14.\n",

      "How to Lose Friends & Alienate People follows the life of Sidney Young, a smalltime, bumbling, British celebrity journalist. In spectacular fashion Sidney enters high society and burns bridges with high society. Of course not perfect, but very enjoyable and funny. Sidney catches the attention of Clayton Harding, editor of Sharp, and accepts a job with the magazine in New York City. Clayton warns Sidney that he'd better impress and charm everyone he can, if he wants to succeed. The storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given. Simon Pegg is still hilarious as ever. Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges were brilliant! Kirsten had some very wonderful moments. Jeff Bridges is just Jeff Bridges! How can you not like him?! He makes Clayton a very humorous character with some wit. Gillian Anderson, Megan Fox, and Danny Huston were great as the supporting cast. One thing I didn't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were. Lose Friends & Alienate People will never be on anyone's top 10 films ever, or even top 10 comedies ever. But it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well.\n",

      "Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe \"How to lose friends & alienate people\". The underlying romance in the plot is, for the most part, displaced by a far more interesting \"rags to riches\" tale. Although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed, in several screen shots, it does have a sense of getting the \"nitty gritty\" out of the way. , playing well on the trans-Atlantic relationship Pegg shares with his co-stars. merging the cross between the high and low -life society quite well and quite refreshingly. The different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film. Every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work. From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy. shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that \"bimbo\" role all to well.\n",

There is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard,courtesy of Simon Pegg's character Sidney. I can't see any other actor in the role of Sidney,and I'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for Pegg. Megan Fox plays spoiled bitchy star Sophie Maes...great role for her.

The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised, but a romantic plot is added. Simon Pegg is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film. \"It's kind of a male 'Ugly Betty', but funnier.

Simon Pegg is great playing Sidney Young, who wrote the book. Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst do work well together, and I think you should see it. Overall, How to lose friends and Alienate people is hilarious. Though there is some odd nudity including Trans-sexuals. Sidney Young, a journalist from England, travels down to New York to work at Sharp magazines. While there, he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does.\n",

      "Based on Toby Young's book about survival in American business, this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques. Labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors, how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond. Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too likable for words. Whether it's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the English actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene. His antics with \"Babe 3\" are unforgivable. , simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing, but he pulls it off splendidly. Bridges and Anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses. Dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest. Megan Fox reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star. Though a British film there is an adaptation of American lifestyle for Young as he tries to fit in. The physical comedy can also be overdone. The inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star's gives this edge. This comedy drama has Simon Pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy, it is worth watching. note, the bloopers on the DVD are some of the finest you will ever see, which are almost half an hour long.\n",

      "UK newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based. How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom. . The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately obnoxious skilled writer. Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects likability too well. Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney's editor a little too effectively. Megan Fox plays a fat 56-year-old English accountant in the new film. The role mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become. However, she does it sweetly, with some skill, and extremely sexily. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and I smiled most of the way through. As ever, the F-word makes appearances when it really doesn't need to, although at least a couple of these are very funny.\n",

      " weak start, solid middle, fantastic finish. I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I've seen him in--- Hot Fuzz, and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, though, took a completely different turn. Shows his range as an actor, but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed. If you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots, Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film. It DOES get better, however. The film's story stopped being annoying, and became kind of a triumph of the \"little guy\" in the final third. As this film got better, it also started to be more and more of a happy ending. It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite, Jeff Bridges, play a role so masterfully. I liked \"Iron Man,\" but was saddened that Bridges' character was a villain. Overall then, I liked it! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late, and missed the beginning. Actually enjoy. actually enjoy. The movie was good, but I wish I'd come in earlier.\n",

      "Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley, a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end. Filmed in Manitoba, Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka, The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book.  Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego-driven, self-defeating character. As she nears the end of her days, she reflects that \"pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear\" Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships, her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice-over narration. The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl. Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly, she meets her future husband. Hagar's relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father. This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka, condemning the young couple to a life of poverty. Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes. ), she is unable to give them the love that they need. Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride, Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm. \"When did I ever speak the heart's truth?\" she reflects. The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story's outcome. The spirited performance by Ellen Page as John's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half. The world is in a state of emergency in the U.S. after the midterm elections. President Barack Obama said he would be willing to meet with President-elect Hillary Clinton to discuss the state of the country.\n",

I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating. The casting of Kowalkski. made me want to see the original. Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role. Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it's made for television. This was not a great movie but it is watchable. The ending packs a strong punch and if one's been involved in the story up to that point, it is a powerful ending. I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way, which I don't usually like. Admittedly, a lot of things were just props for the plot. very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end. The makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well. I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality. I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results. \" meets \"Thelma and Louese\" as well?

I am an English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting. For example: the \"name should scream don't watch\" I put on the subtitles because I'm a Canadian standard English speaker, so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it. It wasn't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so American.

If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer, than I think you'll like it. It's an American film, but it's not a US film.

There's not a lot to hate about this film (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so I can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that's sad.\n",

      "I have yet to see one movie about popular African-influenced dance where the main character was a Black woman. I've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it. I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture. I can't recall ever seeing a popular, mainstream film where all the main characters were Jamaican. The race does not make the film, so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch. The steppers, family, friends, and even the \"thugs\" were all really intelligent, realistic people who were trying to love, live, and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive. Even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle, it still didn't make the plot stereotypical. I respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time, and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world. I don't see that in too many movies nowadays, at least not those that would be considered Black films. I'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this, but I question whether they've been to real step shows. At a real step show, there is zero need for music, other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups. When hip hop songs were played, sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet. Even when there were very small scenes, the ladies tore it up, especially in the auto shop. I know soundtracks have to be sold, but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film. ?\" She looked uncomfortable on screen to me. I thought they should've used a host like Free or Rocsi instead. Deray Davis was funny as usual though. Also, I groaned when I found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto, like it couldn't possibly happen anywhere else. The bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs. the bonus scenes include the Actual Step Shows without All the Songs.

It was borderline distracting at times, but the end result was worth it. Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy. Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her. The story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace, with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence. The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken's TV production company. It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point. \"It is ultimately flawed in so many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters \"cool\", for one) but it works. at the same time.

      "\" Domino \" represents the absolute height of Tony Scott's film-making career. After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema. - the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched-angle framing. This was then carried through to \" Enemy Of The State\" and \"Spy Game\" which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively. \" Domino\" presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory. As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them. Domino is no more disjointed than the \"90210\" culture she has rejected. As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children. To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human. Like any great painting the meaning in \" Domino\" is in the surface and the surface is everything.\n",

      "I read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie. It's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner, yet the writers and Scott chose a different approach. Most Hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know. This plot was one of the more interesting ones I had seen in a while. Domino's plot is both interesting and told. connect with people, often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was. I felt that the characters were accurate. a manner that keeps you thinking, \"oh man, they're screwed now\" Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. He seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him. Choco was also very believable, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations. Claremont/Ladies: I believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story. They weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a Bentley. You could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. Christopher Walken and the 90210 guys provided comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. The mobsters padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting. The use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. I both applaud and congratulate Scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie. , both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob, bounty hunters and the less fortunate. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any at all. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I'm glad that I spent the money for it. Hollywood films have grown predictable and bland. I would recommend this to all, but I'm sure it will only hit a chord with few. \"I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique,\" he said.\n",

      "Documentary came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man. It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things. 'Manufactured Landscapes' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town (many towns, really) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever. 'Our Daily Bread' is a gleefully cold documentary about the food industry. This photographer isn't as interested in seeing people up close. His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and Baltz. All this happens in China, of course, though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site. Edward Burtynsky is the name of the photographer. Age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive. Many stills of photographer's work--or were some of them made by the film crew? It isn't made clear. When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the film's cinematographer Peter Mettler, Burtynsky's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification, and hence falsification. But he is showing us places that, if we look closely, reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect. 'Manufactured Landscapes' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it. The reasons for watching it are two: to see glimpses of Burtynsky's work and the raw materials. Because of the limitations of the narration, the idea of the title 'Manufactured Landscapes' feels insufficiently developed. There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject. Do better to peruse his books or exhibitions. Do better to do better to read his books and exhibitions.

      "I had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape. It certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations, setup shots, and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide. An awful, massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories. The birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the largest industrial project in human history. The time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity. The obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy Save the Earth documentaries. The artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully. 'By not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an an of ignorance,' he says. 'We realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep. It is not a simple right or wrong. It needs a whole new way of thinking' The subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition, but the film images scream that the decision has been made in favor of the dark side. Unlike most films with environmental themes, this one ends with no call to arms. It argues basically what's the point, but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally.\n",

      "Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least \"artful\" objects imaginable. He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them, that is. \"Manufactured Landscapes,\" a documentary about Burtynsky's work, has much of the feel of a \"Koyaanisqatsi\" about it as it dazzles us with its richly var var lens. He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures become part of the industrial landscape. Director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms. Their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China, a dockyard in Bangladesh, and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China. The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the \"themes\" of his work. But it is as a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting image and form, that \"Manufactured Landscapes\" resonates most.\n",

The whole issue of a vital--but aged--woman sent to a rest home against her will, and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing, is touchy material for this comedy.

Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly, and the ways they choose to spend their remaining time. The picture leaves you smiling--and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky. happy ending. The picture was taken in the early 1980s.

It goes like this: A high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders, and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong. Disfigured and back for revenge, sporting a Joker/Jester mask. It features some outrageous killings, and some are quite creative as well. (poisoning of a beer can, acid bath, i can't remember a javelin ever being used in any other slasher film either) It really is a fun, fun movie. That's all it is. Movies like this represent 80's slashers. Never again could movies like this get made, know why? It isn't the 80's anymore. the characters are complete idiots, never mind their stupidity. Never mind the outrageous, random things that occur in this film. The film also had a kick ass villain as well, Marty Rantzen. Simon Scuddamore, who played Marty committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released. I highly recommend this film if you're a hardcore fan of Slahsers such as Friday the 13th.

      "\"Slaughter High\" is perhaps the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s. It is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout. Marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. The victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get. When they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by Marty himself -- you realize they haven't matured all that much. They're a bunch of sociopaths. There are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film. The ending makes little or no sense. The screenwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool's Day works. The movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon. It is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to DVD, when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions.\n",

At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man. I first saw this movie when I was 12 in the sixth grade. I agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered, and that high schools do NOT have bath tubs! I think Caroline Munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent. The reason(s) for his suicide are a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. He looked like a teenager. Probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business.\n",

      "Slaughter High starts like any other day at Doddsville County High School. Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) has tricked resident nerd Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) into the girls locker rooms. The school's sports coach (Marc Smith) saves Marty & punishes the gang. Marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face. Years later the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school. They quickly learn they aren't the only ones there as Marty is back & has revenge on his mind. Slaughter High has three credited writers & directors, George Dugdale, Mark Ezra & Peter Litten. One of the things I like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick, it doesn't try to be anything else. Slaughter High delivers what it promises, a homicidal killer, blood, boobs & babes. The first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another. Despite three credited director's Slaughter High turned out pretty good, I liked the look of the film a lot. The isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good, the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well. There's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots. Technically the film is better than I had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today. Supposedly set in America this was very obviously shot in England. Harry Manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his. Anyone living in the UK will probably recognise Billy Hartman who played Frank as a regular in Emmerdale Farm. While most horror fans will recognise the sexy Caroline Munro in a rare staring role. Legendary exploitation producer Dick Randall did the deed on Slaughter High & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer... talk about typecasting! Slaughter High is a slasher film that I liked a lot, did you see that? I didn't say it was great I actually said I liked it on a personal level & I'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off. Make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out. If your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then Slaughter High won't change your mind. If you are looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this. This is a simple and effective way to cut down on the number of times you need to cut a person's hair.\n",

      "This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all. It stars Caroline Munro, from both Dr. Phibes films (she was his wife that died!), Dracula A.D. 1972, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac, and Faceless. It opens on April Fools Day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd. The coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. But, the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive. The school is storming when they break in. They find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and belongings. They also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying \"Oooh yesser! Yesser!\" and then is killed. The movie takes a page out of Alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a j.. Pretty pointless character, but hes still my favorite. Rent, buy, or steal this great movie to find out! The movie is actually very good, filled with clichés (car wont start, DAMMIT!) and just plain slasher fun. 1989's Cutting Class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell.Favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't. \"Talk dirty to me, Frank!!\" she screams.

      "I have seen Slaughter High several times over the years, and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor. I never knew that it was filmed in the UK, and I never known that the actor that plays Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore) committed suicide after the film was released. I guess I did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for Americans. Marty is the butt of jokes from his classmates, and on one particular day, April Fools Day, he's lured into the girl's locker room by one Caroline Munro (yes, playing a teenager) The coach catches the gang at work & they're all given a vigorous workout to punish them. Ten years later, this same gang is headed for their class reunion at Doddsville High. They manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict...except there's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course, they eat, drink, and be merry. For soon, they will die, of course. A girl takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer. She is victim to an acid bath which I believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version, because it seemed extra nasty when I watched it this time. There's somewhat of a twist ending, and that also contains footage not on the tape, I believe. There's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised. If you're a fan of 80's slasher flicks then snap up the new release DVD. A good atmosphere & feel to it. 7 out of 10. a good atmosphere and feel to the place. 7 of 10 for the food, 7 of 8 for the service. 7.5 out of 8.\n",

A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen. The acting is terrible but that is fine.

      "A bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) which leaves him hideously disfigured. Five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion. An angry and vindictive Marty shows up dressed in a jester's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors. Gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, a guy being crushed under a huge tractor, and two people getting electrocuted while in a car. There's gratuitous female nudity, a totally ridiculous \"what the hell?\" supernatural climax, tacky make-up f/x, and one of those lovably lame \"it was all just a terrible dream\" fake-out non-endings. The cast all give solid performances, with especially stand-out work from Carmine Iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader Skip Pollack. Co-producer Dick Randall has an amusing cameo as Munro's sleazy agent Manny. Harry Manfredini's moody, rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his \"Friday\" \"Friday the 13th\" is good, trashy fun. Alan Pudney's slick cinematography does the trick. The film is rated PG-13 for violence, language and some sexual content.\n",

      "The story is about a teenaged girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns down her house. The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though, inspite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn. The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a David Lynch film. The cinematography of the rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb. Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: \"The world's not as big as I thought\" - i. This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying. You are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one. (i.e., It's a small world.)\n",

Most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of Favor and his men. Rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me, as yet anyhow, managed to do so. The black and white photography added to a bleak, realistic feel that other western series seldom managed. The final season was axed less than half way through. Eric Fleming had departed and Rawhide was now a head without a body. The gritty realism was gone, Gil Favor commanded respect and exuded authority.\n",

The drovers who worked for trail boss Gil Favor as played by Eric Fleming were no different. But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it. Clint Eastwood's western image was molded by Rawhide, it's a shame that these are not shown more often. Had this been an NBC show, this would have been done in color like Bonanza. Eric Fleming was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name. Sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film, drowned in a river. Had he lived he might have become a name like Eastwood's. These were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year.

      "Presenting Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easier roles she had while at MGM. Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with. A young girl with talent enough for ten, she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater. Both Judy and Heflin hail from the same small town. Their respective moms, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington have kept in touch. No real big song hits came out of Presenting Lily Mars for Garland. Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where Heflin's show is being produced. Gilchrist was a star back in the days of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in grand style. Marta Eggerth is in Presenting Lily Mars as the show's star. She did a couple of films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent. I'm betting MGM didn't quite know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent. Presenting Lily Mars is a fine showcase for the talents of Judy Garland. And she didn't have to share the screen in another backstage film with Mickey Rooney.in was just coming off his Oscar for Johnny Eager the previous year and he and Garland wouldn't appear to be an ideal screen team.\n",

      "Lily Mars, a smalltown girl living in Indiana, dreams of making it big on Broadway. Her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show, only as a favor to her family. Charming film, and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, while supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was in the role. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together, but a very enjoyable film. with Lily rather than be the romantic. Rating, 7.5 out of 10.\n",

      "With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job. They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film. David Newman provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping. The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Manfred' being a particular treat. The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from' This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.\n",

      "\"Ice Age\" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company's first. We are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge), a woolly mammoth named Manny, a sloth named Sid, and a saber toothed tiger named Diego. The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that, he caused an avalanche. We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age (except for Manny, who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him) Sid comes out of his cave yawning, and saw that his family abandoned him. He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Unfortunately, he gets pursued by Sylvia (voiced by Kirsten Johnston of \"3rd Rock from the Sun\") Female orange sloth, who wants Sid to go migrating with her. Sid eventually teams up with Manny, and they became friends. Meanwhile, nearby a human tribe, Soto (voiced by Goran Visnjic), an evil saber toothed tiger, wants revenge against the tribe's leader. Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, Sylvia, and Roshan are the main characters. The supporting characters include a pack of wolves, a purple sloth named Jennifer, and a fat female purple sloths named Jennifer. Two rhinos, Carl (voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI's \"Madagascar\"), and Frank (voicing by Stephen Root of Pixar's \"Finding Nemo\"), are simple minor characters. Same went for the dodos, who are using melons as their food supply. Manny talks through his trunk saying, \"I'M NOT GOING!\" When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit, Sid asks Jennifer \"What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens?\" Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth and tells Diego to eat him. \" is not only a success, but it has 2 sequels: the first one was \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\", which was released in 2006, and the other was \" ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\", which is going to be releasing next year. I can hardly die waiting to see what \"Ice age: Dawn Of The Dinosaurs\" will be like.\n",

      "Set in the year 2010 (hey, that's not too far away now!) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. The government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! Oh the insanity! Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain. Britain didn't like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him. , nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames Bonaparte. There's also Specs, the bifocal genius, Bible quoting/God fearing Chaplain, purple MO-hawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief. The \"villains\" are a cyborg named Buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as \"Green Peace\" In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds. In the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting of a naked Buaku. This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you'd better go get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven in places but still a lot of fun. Followed by \"New Dominion: Tank Police\".\n",

      " Dominion is a cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society. The \"heroes\" of Dominion are the Tank Police, formed with a \"if we can't beat crime, we'll get bigger guns\" philosophy. The animation is not state of the art, but it's very nice otherwise. The colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion. Most, if not all, of these cops are borderline(?) psychopaths and neurotics.  Dominion Tank Police is great. It's Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy. dubbing is, again, lots of fun. The soundtrack of the English version is also very good. Highly recommended.\n",

      "The film is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode. It is the story of love, both genuine and illicit, as well as overweening ambition, devotion, and the arrogance of personal tyranny. To miss this point is to miss the point. The point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking. The son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. The film is set on a plantation in Ceylon, today's Sri Lanka. The elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long? Much of the film was shot in Ceylon, and the magnificent \"bungalow\" this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place, as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power. The wonderfully carved Jalees (grille work window and doorway borders) evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought. This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in, not on the home TV. So arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope.\n",

      "\"Masks\" is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child. Although, at times the story makes the old man into a Job, it is easy to move beyond his plight. This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults. The film was released in the U.S. to get Americans who may not like foreign language films to see it.

      "Many of the superb Chinese movies are very accurate retellings of actual, true stories. Farewell, my Concubine, The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples. In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks. Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader. All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art. But the son eventually is found out to be a girl. From there, the story get very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang.

      "King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian, a street performer in 1930s China. The film was so astonishingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and well-addressed. There is the gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place, no one wants a little girl. Wang Bianlian's story goes on from there. attva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and well-respected, he regards himself as something low, a half woman. As we go further into the film, the face the issues of human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution. It was yet another beautiful performance.

For much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set. The film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today. Both the Communist revolution and the World War 2 cataclysm raise vital issues even today, both both of which are still vital today. The central character's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions is poignant. The film is about the inequality between boys and girls, men and women, corruption in society, injustice and the importance of friendship. It is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the United Kingdom, whilst dross is passed off as quality material.\n",

      "What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting: small-town China in the 1930's. Extreme poverty was the norm, and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson, whom he's nicknamed \"Doggie,\" is a granddaughter, he initially casts her out. The film is gritty then, showing the lengths to which a young, street-smart girl had to go to survive in that society. The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. . Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status, though, that I did, too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern, suburban child, it's completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode. Of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film. The film is out now on Blu-ray, DVD and video. For more information on the film, visit the official website.\n",

      "Five years ago, many people were moved to tears by \"Titanic\" The movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too well. Today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully. The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful. To say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed. Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed. \"Titanic\" is a classic movie about a doomed love affair that ends in disaster.\n",

It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.

      "I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. \"I didn't want to like it - and I didn't,\" says Tom Hanks. \"What a great movie,\" he says of Titanic. Hanks: \"The directing. First - the directing\" James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost \"you are there\" type of atmosphere. Lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent. Frances Fisher was perfect as Rose's mother. You could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of \"My Heart\" The romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive. 9.9/10. A minor quibble, though.\n",

      "I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. Even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie. So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was \"overhyped\"...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being \"over Hyped\" ha! Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not thier best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before.\n",

      "Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane) Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America. The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic. One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking through their eyes. The Titanic set sail from Southhampton, Ireland on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs. , an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information. The basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic. Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. Many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who who who died. Officer Lowe was on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'. Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss did not want to leave him. The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the times. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking. A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives. The moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film. It took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. A special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk. Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic. Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.\n",

      "James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event... It's an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope, love and humanity...Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma... Conveying passion, trust, insouciance and ingenuity. Billy Zane is an arrogant racist, abusive and ultra rich who would lie, cheat, steal, bribe with money or even use an innocent young child to escape defeat... He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI. Molly Brown is the legendary unsinkable Molly Brown, the richest woman in Denver, who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship. Victor Garber is the master shipbuilder, the real-life character who attempts to fix time, to measure it, in a sense, to make it into history. Bill Paxton is the opportunistic under-ish mother who forces her daughter to become engaged to marry a rich, supercilious snob. Gloria Stuart is the 101-year old woman who reveals a never-before told love story... The nightmare, the horror and the shock are imprinted upon her deeply lined face... 'Titanic' is loaded with luminous photography and sweeping visuals. explorer in search for a very rare diamond called the \"Heart of the Ocean\" iors; the first sight of the Titanic steamed steadily toward her date with destiny; the Titanic, leaving the Southampton dock, and some dolphins appear jumping, racing along in front of the luxurious ship.

      " 1997 was a big year for the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time. The Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was. , 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14. A couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Titanic is a great movie, best movie of all time, no, just depends on your idea of a good movie. Titanic delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage. ining nude, wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic. Rose Dewitt-Bukater and her mother Ruth DeWitt Bukater are financially broke. Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. A drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship. Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again. She asks Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean, an engagement present from Jack. After witnessing a woman encouraging her seven-year-old daughter to behave like a \"proper lady\" at tea, Rose defies him and her mother. . After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time, they go to the deck of the ship. They then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg. Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal. Meanwhile, Cal discovers Rose's nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe. Jack and Rose return to the top deck. Cal and Jack, though enemies, both want Rose safe, so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack, Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. It will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. 10/10. do recommend this movie, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day. \"The Godfather\" is one of the best films of the 20th century.\n",

      "For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in in. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable.\n",

Maybe, it's just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose.

      "Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. \"The love story is too cheesy\" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit. I personally think they are both very talented actors who are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. If one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because. they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then. I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie. I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected. Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times. Overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic. I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it. I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement. \"I was shocked by the realistic adaptation of events. horrified by the realism of the film,\" says one viewer. \"I was like, 'Oh my God, what is going on?' \"\n",

      "Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. let also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship. DiCaprio and Winslet definitely make this movie worth the time to watch. from the cast especially DiCaprio, Winslet who definitely make it worth the watch. From the cast, especially Di Caprio and winslet who make this film worth the watching.\n",

      "The RMS Titanic was one of the biggest tragedies ever. James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. This is my second review of his movies. Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) are not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying. The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane) The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome. the said diamond.\n",

      "\"Titanic\" was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users. While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating. In previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in \"Titanic\" No one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for \"Titanic\" is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture. I. am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6. Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste. \"Heaven's Gate\" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing. \"Big Top Pee-wee\" ( 1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5). \"Cat People\" (1982) got 6.1% 10 Ratings and 2.6% 1 Ratings (over all rating of 5.1) ). \"Blind Date\" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" (1986) got 4.4% 10 Ratings and 3.7% 1 Ratings (over all rating of5.2). WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH \" TITANIC\"? ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER THAN \"TITANIC\", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD. \"Titanic\" got 10.7% 1 ratings. Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned. Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?\n",

      "What's inexplicable? Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. Titanic is a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. The acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times. But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. This is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. If you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10. . how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.\n",

The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death. The one we are witness of -the movie. The first half is based upon recollecting information; later things turn into Aro's childhood, giving the movie such an incredible new force (even tough never got weak or boring).

      "While every movie has its flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count. If you read the last review, you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. Despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. This is a thriller, not a horror, and it should be approached as such. The story really will amaze you, even more so because it's true. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast. He has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener. Patrick Stettner's direction was moody and dark, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those conditions. I actually know something about direction. I've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. The only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction. -sought-after feelings of \"tension and release\" rather than the messy, fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we're so often subjected to today. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized, which is as an eyeball through which we all see. Don't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it, especially if they're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show! -Ben\n",

The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially \"Insomnia\" and \"One Hour Photo\" \"The Night Listener\", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period. . The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic \"caretaker\". Her role was a far cry from those she had had before. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation. There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. Be prepared to be unsettled.

No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin. No one decides to do some investigating into Donna and Pete's backgrounds discovering some truths he didn't anticipate. Williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him. The film has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation. The film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner. It pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.\n",

      "Robin Williams and Toni Collette star in \" psychological thriller\" based on true events. Film's official synopsis: \"Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret\" Film's ending: \"How did he lose his leg?\" Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) don't seem, initially, believable as a couple. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a \"director's cut\"? Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect. Best of all, Collette's \"Donna\" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere. Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin.\n",

      "Homelessness (or Houselessness as George Carlin stated) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism, the war on Iraq, pressuring kids to succeed, technology, the elections, inflation. Mel Brooks (who directs) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries. If Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. Bolt is on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk. He's given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it's written on his forehead. Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly (Lesley Ann Warren) who got divorce before losing her home. While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn't necessary to plot, I found \"Life Stinks\" to be one of Mel Brooks' observant films. It shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, or Spaceballs. Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others. Like Monopoly money. like MonopolyMoney. likeMonopoly money like Mon monopoly money. or maybe this movie will inspireYou to help Others. like it did me.\n",

And so should you, if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive, soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form. Stone Angel very much reminded me of the much praised \"The Notebook\". I am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie. Even If you've not seen The Notebook, nor read the book on which this move is based, (which, incidentally, is based on) you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully.

Tsui set a tone for the New Wave's approach to the martial arts film. \"Burning Paradise\" put a stop to all that. The film is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of Red Lotus Temple. The Abbot in \"Red Temple\" is the very incarnation of Milton's Satan from \"Paradise Lost\" He wants people to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. There's a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just just is no way out. Not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge. Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience. . .... . . .. . ... .... . ..... ... .......... .,. .. ....... ...! ....\n",

      "\"Burning Paradise\" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. The fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. The film even better is that anyone could die at anytime, there is no holding back.

There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie, from the first one.

But mind, there's also a lot of blood that flows (people cut in half, decapitated, etc). Yep, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film. It's Ringo Lam! Ace. Ace.

      "This movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic KING KONG from 1976. It not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness, but successfully predicted much of Peter Jackson's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name. The film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex -- the Yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package. But as a trade-off you DO get a wacky old scientist, two inquisitive kids, Tony Kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous. Glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands, a monster who's size literally changes scale from shot to shot. Some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make carnage in GODZILLA VS THE SMOG MONSTER look tame by comparison. Crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either Spanish, Italian or Canadian extras depending upon scene. you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed), and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie. Frank Kramer is actually the same Gianfranco Parolini who brought the world SARTANA in 1968 and GOD'S GUN the year before. This is his most adventuresome movie ever, or rather the one he took the most chances with. The movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless. If the movie had been played seriously it wouldn't have worked. With all it's faults + clunkiness, Kramer's YETI is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this, which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages. I'd rank this up there with KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA and IT! CURSE OF THE GREAT GOLEM. Parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie I will ever share with the grandkids someday. This is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid. \"You only come around once and I'd rather go out with a smile on my face. about ten minutes too long but who cares, you only come along once,\" he said. \"I was in a good mood, I was smiling.

Yeti is mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents. Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti (once he thaws - which takes FOREVER) -- and he is instantly in love with her. There's a collie dog in it because the Italian producer must have heard that American audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a Lassie.

      "Being a giant monster fan, me seeing \"Yeti\" was an absolute must, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily, and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually, dare I say, decent. Yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert, and really, he's not that bad of a dude, especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing. Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he doesn't even rampage (actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out. We want to see the giant Yeti do his thing, and he's pretty much in the whole movie. A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well. In another, he uses the windows of a building as \"ladder\" \"Yeti\" never stoops as low as say, \"A.P.E.\" does. The only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an \"oh yeah baby\" manner. \"Yeti\" may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks, but it is definitely better than other King Kong '76 rip-offs. The story is actually good, and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy.\n",

      "Laurent Firode made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of France in recent memory. The film deals with chance, as its English title indicates. The French title makes reference at how butterflies wings can create chaos over the Atlantic as they fly. A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film. Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is. After Irene leaves the train, the quiet young man seated next to the woman tells her he has the same sign. Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, doesn't have a lot to do until the end. The talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film.

      "A year ago I was introduced to Audrey Tautou, a French actress, whom I first saw in The Fabulous Destiny of Amel. Narratives generally try to avoid too may characters; readers and viewers, after all, can be too easily overwhelmed by trying to keep track of who exactly is who. This is especially true in film, I think, simply because we cannot easily go back to refresh our memory in a cinema. This earlier offering exceeds the others in both ways: more characters and more complexity. Other directors have used those techniques before: Robert Altman with The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia. The film is about a young woman, Irene (Tautou) who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day. Some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods. Two young people go their separate ways with neither realizing the potential significance of their close encounter. However, chaos results throughout the rest of the day, not only for the two young people, but for the other characters who appear in a series of cleverly constructed vignettes. Irene and her man of destiny meet again in this new novel. The novel uses innovative scenes that are all too commonplace, but which are turned into believable, extraordinary events. For example, some bird poo from the sky drops onto a book or paper. \"I'll let you think about that, should you see this delightful romp,\" says the reviewer. \"I can't decide whether this guy was THE ONE for Irene, or whether it was, in fact, the young man on the train,\" he adds.\n",

      "This isn't exactly a great film, but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future. In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS. The pace is brisk, the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all. The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting. I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots.\n",

      "To the French it is \"Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon\" Serendipity? Fate? Perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings. I'd watch it again if I had some incentive. A 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble. All these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture? Dominoes. We admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer/director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, here's the place to do it. Soren Kierkegaard is attributed with the following: \"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forward.\" If you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it.\n",

There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil city. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. You even have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes.

This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real timeless quality. The Rock stars in the film, which is one of the lost gems of the late 80s.

In 1969 when this concert was shot, the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone. Musicians are encouraged to improvise. Try the concert out, it really is amazing. What you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged. It's a curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music.\n",

      "Uneven Bollywood drama. Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada. Film is compelling, its few song/dance numbers are uninteresting and needless, the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for this film's drama. One number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative, if ultimately misplaced as well. Likewise, the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happy-go-lucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce. The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord, and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his long-suffering wife. But Sanjay himself overacts terribly, especially during obvious ad-libs. The directorial style of writer/director Krishna Wamsi is sloppy, rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts. ShAKTI is Karisma Kapoor's film, all the way. intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes. The musical underscore is also quite effective, moody, featuring wordless female voice over small orchestral ensemble. , Karisma's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures. In a strange way, also, I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I'd noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE. The film is about a man whose self-serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another. There is a notable subtext to the film.\n",

      "If any movie stands out extremely with the actors' acting skills, this is probably the one. I've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way, but having a strong feeling. The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place. Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date, and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza. Nana Patekar was excellent as her father-in-law. direction was not bad, but certainly nothing one can brag about. Deepti Naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene. Sanjay Kapoor was all right, but he didn't have much to do. Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role. Hum Tum Miley was properly paced, but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie. Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about. Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a movie. Despite the poor editing, the performances alone make it a must see. to get the mood of the movie. The film is directed by Alex Gansa and is based on the novel by the same name. The movie was released on September 14, 2013.\n",

      "The film tells the story of an Indian woman, Nandini, who lives in Canada with her husband Shekhar and little kid Raja. All of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in India is in troubles and the couple rush to India. When they get into the village, Nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture. Nandini starts nagging Shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. When she wants to leave, Narasimha refuses to let her take Raja back to India. The locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and Krishna Vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. The portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. Such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. Karisma Kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as Nandini. Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. Portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. After Fiza, this is her most powerful performance. Her outbreaks while facing off Nana Patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. epti Naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. Sanjay Kapoor is just adequate and Shahrukh Khan provides great comic relief. Do watch Shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.\n",

      "Seeing this movie was the most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. It's all in there, adding up to a myth. The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khan's dream of Aishwarya Rai. At one point, the story borrows from \"Not without my baby,\" but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice. Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar. Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters. At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal. Every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic. Shakti\" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. Most fun in the world. most fun in world! most fun, most fun. mostFun in the World! mostFun, mostFun. most Fun in theWorld! mostfun, mostfun. mostfun in the. world!MostFun,mostFun, MostFun,MostFun.\n",

      "The Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevi's first home-production. The story of the film revolves around Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) who lives in Canada with her two uncles. Shekhar (Master Jai Gidwani) has a boy, Raja (Deepti Naval) They leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India. From the moment they reach India, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people. A frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. After that, they drive to the handing Havel where shekhar''s father, Narsimha (Nana Patekar) lives with his wife. Nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. Terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land. Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. Ismail Darbar''s music fails to rise above the script. The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena. Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Pr-climax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy. Shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments. Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days. The Pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening. The film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.\n",

      "'De Grot' is a terrific Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei' was made into the great Dutch mystery thriller called 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') in 1988. This one is not as good as that thriller, but there are times it comes close. From this point the movie is constantly flashback and flash-forward. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and acted. A kind of suspense is created that you would normally not have in an opening scene like this. The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as kids, than as students, young adults, and in their mid-thirties. But from time to time, like I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids. The title means 'The Cave', and it is the cave that gives the movie its happy ending, although it is in fact not that happy. Like the beginning, the ending is terrific. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and in a way it distracts our attention of the first scenes. The U.S. has a long way to go before it can be considered a nation of immigrants. The U.K. has more immigrants than any other country in the world. There are more than 100,000 immigrants in the U.N. alone.\n",

      "Tim Krabbe is the praised author of 'Het Gouden Ei', a novel that was put on the screen twice ('Spoorloos' and 'The Vanishing') One of the Dutch writer's more recent works is 'De Grot', a psychological thriller about two totally different men, Egon and Axel. Axel has a strong influence on Egon, while the latter envies him because he has a good life. Egon is even dragged by Egon into illegal practices himself, which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant Asian country. The story feels surprisingly remote: you often need to know a character's background to really care for him or her. Another complaint was the fact that the main characters, Egon and Axel, are a little stereotypical. Egon IS 'the' dull intellectual, while Axel IS his exact opposite. Despite all this, the film was a pleasant surprise, being much better than the book. Fedja van Huet (Egon) is one of the few Dutch actors who can make you forget he IS acting. The drawbacks of the film, however, are the same as the book's: mainly because the characters are one-dimensional. This talented director (that's what the movie makes clear anyway) is hampered by a deficient screenplay. Perhaps Koolhoven should just have chosen a better book. 7.7/10\n",

Termite Terrace. \"Snafu\" is an illustration of the damaging power of rumors. The setting is an Army camp. Private Snafu sits next to another soldier in the latrine (something you won in the cartoon) The imagery is indeed vivid: the brain of one anxious soldier is depicted as a percolating pot. The fevered speech of another is rendered as steamy hot air. A soldier \"shoots his mouth off,\" cannon-style, and before you know it actual baloney is flying in every direction. Soldiers tell each other that the Brooklyn Bridge has been pulverized, Coney Island wiped out, enemy troops have landed on the White House lawn. The visuals become ever more surreal and nightmarish until at last the camp is quarantined for \"Rumor-itis\" and Private Snafu is locked up in a padded cell. RUMORS is a rare example of a wartime educational film whose essential message doesn't feel at all dated. The Private Snafus of our time are able to broadcast their own balloon juice via e-mail, cellphones and blogging.\n",

      "i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. The whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace. The cast and crew of the hit TV show \"Boardwalk Empire\" gave their thoughts on the film. They also gave their opinions on the movie and what they thought it was about.

OK, there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well. But from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on. In summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me, but it was a close call. The talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest: it wasn't really very funny.\n",

      "On all fronts: script, cast, director, photography, and high production values, etc. Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom/com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston. A movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males. As other IMDb reviewers here have noted, there is nothing lame about this gem --no hack writing or acting. And finally, Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie, instead of lesser films. As a long-time and hard-core atheist, I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment. This movie exposes popular, but otherwise hackneyed, movies like \"Ghost\" for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are. \"Into the Night\" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager. \"Blind Date\" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger. \"American Dreamer\" with JoBeth Williams. \"Making Mr. Right\" with John Malkovich. even if it's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years.

To tell the truth I hadn't really noticed it until I read these comments, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue sounds more British than American. I thought these actors did a good job of it, but hey, I'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily. Don't get me wrong though, it has to be a sentimental scene, and this movie had plenty of those.

      "I'd have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a \"Lifetime\" presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether \"set\" there, in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, L.A. etc., are filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or some other Canadian locale. It's also been done pretty often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al. Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and many more. I can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, who could be added now. Best of this genre I've seen. I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday, at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. I'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. The chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends, as a sub-story romance, is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here. The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING, in caps. This adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters. With a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by \"You've Got Mail\" and \"Goodfellows\" leepless in Seattle.\" Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan. Co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films, as well.\n",

      "I was all ready to pan this episode, seeing that this 'Master' really doesn't have any horror films under his belt.. but this is easily the best episode of the season. While you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise, at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins, something that has been lacking up to this point in the series. \"Really good effort. Like I've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes.. but they may someday end up being masters in the future. twist per say, but just a funny little bit where he becomes, as ever, the hen-pecked hubby.\"\n",

      "Fans of the HBO series \"Tales From the Crypt\" are going to love this MOH episode. Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door. Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist. When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of \"making up,\" and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull the plug. azier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen) Abbey's never been one to give up without a fight, and that's where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter. You don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.) Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. This is the latest in a long line of dismemberment-themed episodes. The extremely squeamish need not apply. This one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismembering.\n",

      "A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. When the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. The decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him. As of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet. Great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. I was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore. the most liberal sense. Some images do remind me of \"Hellraiser 2\". However, I in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. I can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than \"HellRAiser 2\" The subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and I found myself going back and forth about whether I disliked the main character for his relationship with her. He's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. I feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he's completely unlovable. This is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. When legends like John Carpenter let me down I get a bit worried about the genre's future, but then a fresh face like Rob Schmidt comes along and gives me hope. This one is a keeper, and please bring Schmidt back for season 3!\n",

      "\"Right To Die\" is the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season. We are treated to the story of Cliff and his relationship with his girlfriend. The episode was directed by Rob Schmidt and written by John Esposito. . At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation. Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back. While they speak, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with only scratches and bruises. Abbey is thrown from the car and catches on fire when a spark ignites and gasoline that had dripped onto her catches her on fire. Hands down this is the best episode of the season and certainly ranks as one of the top episodes ever. From the gruesome effects to the taut script which threw in a few twists I never saw coming and suspense so palpable you can almost touch it, Right To Die should have the right to go on living forever.\n",

      "\"Right to Die\" is one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the \"Masters of Horror\" franchise. Schmidt previously just directed one horror film called \"Wrong Turn\" and that one just was slightly above mediocre. The story of \"Right to Die\" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. \"Right to Die\" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TV-series concept like \"Masters of Horror\". It's violent, it's funny and it's a great episode. The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks. Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. The 2010-11 season was the first season in the Premier League since 2005-06. The season was won by Manchester United, who went on to win the title. The match was played in front of a crowd of more than 100,000.\n",

      "Masters of Horror: Right to Die starts late one night as married couple Abby (Julia Anderson) & Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) are driving home. While talking Cliff is distracted & crashes into a tree that has fallen across the road. Cliff's airbag works OK & he walks away with minor injuries. Unfortunately for Abby hers didn't & she ended up as toast when she was thrown from the car & doused in petrol. This American Canadian co-production was directed by Rob Schmidt (whose only horror film previously was Wrong Turn (2003) This was episode 9 from season 2 of the Masters of Horror TV series, while I didn't watch it. The script by John Esposito has a neat central idea that isn't anything new but it uses it effectively enough. The first 15 minutes of this focuses on the horror element of the story but then it goes into a lull for 20 odd minutes as it becomes a drama. The legal wrangling over Abby's life & the affair Cliff is having take center stage. The character's are a bit clichéd, the weak man, the bent lawyer, the protective mum & the young tart who has sex to get what she wants. The dialogue is OK, the story moves along at a nice pace & overall I liked Right to Die apart from a few minutes here & there where it loses it's focus a bit. I wasn't that keen on the ambiguous ending. There are some fantastic special make-up effects as usual, there's shots of Abby where she has had all of the skin burned off her body & the image of her bandaged head with her teeth showing because she has no lips left is pretty gross. There's the main course at the end where Cliff literally skins someone complete with close-ups of scalpels slicing skin open & him peeling it off the muscle. Technically Right to Die is excellent, the special effects are brilliant & as most Masters of Horror episodes it doesn't look like a cheap made-for-TV show. There are also various assorted body parts. There's some nudity here as well with at least a couple of pretty ladies getting naked... Well worth a watch... for those with the stomach. not just for the terrific skinning scene.

Matt Le Blanc- Man, his acting was down right dreadful because until later, he gets more confident, but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails. David Schimmer- Why does he over pronounce EVERY word? he cannot speak normally! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons, but he isn't confident. and i cannot sympathise with him Jennifer Aniston- Looks hot, and does do. Courtney Cox- Looks quite anorexic in this episode, its worrying, she looks totally different now, (more healthily), she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry- I'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb, and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as Pheobe. Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing himself basically! \"I hope we see the Friends reunite! cause they will always be there for us!\" \"The acting is OK, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot!\" \"Such as the Sets, they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly\"\n",

Shinjuku is one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. If he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Shinjuku concerns relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period. The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again. The world is in a state of emergency in the U.S. after the midterm elections.

      "Shinjuku Triad Society, albeit from perfect, is a fiercely compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber-conventional realm. It's a yakuza/triad picture, involving cops versus Japanese &/or Chinese gangsters (mostly Chinese, as the title suggests) It's certainly not as surreal as some of Miike's most recent films, but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn. It's equally savage and heartfelt, crazy (in spots) and sardonic in its drama, and solid for genre fans. The story concerns two brothers, one a Chinese orphan raised in Japan, Tatsuhito Kiriya (Kippei Shiina) The main arch likely takeover gang comes from Wang (a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare-time) There's some intrigue involving the organ-trading scheme with the gangsters, which Kiriya almost becomes a victim of. It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare. If it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it's par for the course of a film like this. Miike's goals are met, though just met, in his low-scale ambitions. Shinjuku Triad Society contains more than a few moments of classic biting black-comedy from the Miike oeuvre. There's even a laugh-out-loud line from the young sex-slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses: \"Thank you, Mr. Mr. in the characters\" There's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters. Miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like Ichi.\n",

      "Takashi Miike's first film as a director, this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller, with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with. What takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same- old however, is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today's films. . And this isn't that nice cool, clean violence so beloved of US cinema - this stuff is nasty, painful and HURTS! That said, the pace is breakneck, the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities. Miike's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments.

      "I loved this film. Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr. fan, I prefer to appreciate his \"boundless enthusiasm\" and acknowledge his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one racked with pain. The film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful. We get insight into Ed's personal and professional life. about him from all perspectives, positive and negative, and showing us their character as much as Ed's. Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies. New comers will be amazed that this man was real. The DVD is full of impossible to find gems. The real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story. The most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was Ed Wood Jr., but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created. Somehow, without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time, the connection that Ed Wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear, and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement. Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint. This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get. It is at once respectful, provocative, thoughtful, gripping, fun, sad, kind, and fulfilling.\n",

Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations. It is interesting (somewhat) but was this really needed? Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out. I wouldn't say he was the worst director ever but he's down there. More than a few of those interviewed (especially Lugosi Jr.) pretty much hated the man. Vampira and Dolores Fuller are best friends. Vampira is a long time girlfriend of Wood's. Fuller is Wood's ex-girlfriend. The pair have a long history of feuding.\n",

      "Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain. A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly film to watch. It presents a scenario that's all too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target. Lindy was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didn't kill her own child. Through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. This stance, of course, is the power of strength. Meryl Streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold, but not unfeeling woman. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to, or the Chamberlains would be. The news-media will always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public. detached, and no one wants to see that. Except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news- media.\n",

It especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas. The leads play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals. Some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in Australia as comic actors. I think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers. It captured the themes of the story brilliantly. \"If you could, you would\" is a general principle that should apply to all acting as well.

      "I found it hard to like anyone in this film. The central characters, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, whose daughter disappears during a night out in the Australian outback, are not bad people. But then surely not all, or even most, of the scores of people we see throughout this movie would be bad if we knew them better. Not a movie about the degenerate society of Australia in particular; it's merely an account of a true story that happened there. Society en masse is much less evolved than the individual feels ensured that we are. The evidence against Lindy Chamberlain aside, suspicion was jet-fueled mostly by a virtue of hers. To the public eye, she did not seem sufficiently distraught by the death of her baby daughter. The reason I appreciate the film is because it turns the focus inside out. Meryl Streep, one of, if not the, greatest actress working today, may not give a performance that particularly stands out. But she, and the screenwriters, do understand Lindy. What is infuriating is that it's not that difficult. Whether or not her performance is as immediately gratifying as Sophie's Choice, The Devil Wears Prada, Angels In America or other such work, it is a triumph. It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself. Meryl Streep and Sam Neill are constantly on screen, but the Australian public plays the real leads here. Whatever happened to the little girl, her parents were part of a margin with whom most of the media's intake didn't immediately identify. The first inclination was to go after them like a pack of hungry...well... Director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office. The setting's atmosphere doesn't give a pleasurable enough compensation for the fact that no performance or facet of production stands out. It is very successful as an indictment of the collective conscious of the public.\n",

      "In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation. The media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were baying for blood. What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice. Lindy never proved her innocence, so she was found guilty. There was never enough evidence to convict her, yet the jury was swayed by public and media pressure. How could we as a nation even sit in judgement? From where we are, how could we possibly presume to know? Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light. He shows Australia in a rather unbecoming light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the Chamberlains pay! The outstanding Meryl Streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts. Sam Neill is every bit as good as Streep as the at first faithful but then disillusioned Michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart. For all Aussies this is a must see, a shocking look in the mirror if you will. The film is brilliant too, with Director of Photography Ian Baker capturing this great land with splendour (especially the Rock) Editor Jill Bilcock keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged. Bruce Smeaton provides a telling score. Even on return viewings Fred Schepisi's account of the travesty of justice that befell the Chamberlains is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving. As Michael Chamberlain said : \"I don't think anybody really understands what innocence means.....to innocent people\" John Bryson's novel to the screen, telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong. New born daughter Azaria was taken form the family tent by a dingo just moments after being put down.Amid media speculation and vicious public rumour Lindy was charged with the murder of her baby. Meryl Streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles Australia head on to prove her innocence. She is truly awesome, and the only thing that fails her is a true blue Aussie accent. Alongside Meryl is an equally impressive Sam Neill, outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes. Strong Aussie cast lend compelling support. Ian Baker's cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant. Bruce Smeaton's music is perfect for the part. Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.\n",

      "A CRY IN THE DARK was a film that I anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from Meryl Streep and a solid, if unremarkable film. Aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups. Little did I anticipate that A CRY In THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level. The audience settle into the Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that, at the core, they are an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy and Michael care for their children. The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the Chamberlain's continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court, which suspects Lindy of murder. The fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping. , the media/public opinion is understandable. I loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic, but they always had valid reasons to hold their views. In terms of performances, the only ones that really matter in this film are those of Streep and Neill... and they deliver in every way. This is undoubtedly Neill's finest work to date. It's a shame he wasn't recognized by the Academy with a Leading Actor nomination to match Streep's... b/c he's so charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK. More emotionally gripping than most films, and also incredibly suspenseful. I highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where Meryl screams \"The dingo took my baby!\" watch the film and see just how much more there is to A CRY IN THE DARK.\n",

      "This review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based. The right to be presumed \"Innocent until proven guilty\" is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society. According to Fred Schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous Australian murder trial, it was not granted to Lindy Chamberlain, accused of killing her baby. 'A Cry in the Dark' is well acted throughout, especially by Meryl Streep, who puts on a convincing Australian accent. Although Chamberlain was eventually released, this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence \"proving\" their innocence, something no defendants should have to produce. The wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the British popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts. The scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking, because we believe in the characters as real. I'm not a religious man, but the Bible still contains some killer lines (if you'll excuse the pun). \"Judge not lest ye be judged\" is one of them. The voices that put Lindy Chamberlain away are exactly the same pit of evil.\n",

Those with supporting roles are also quite good. You will remember this movie for many years.\n",

The riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture, after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye-opening fable. People who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes.

The film is based on the true story of a man who was found guilty of cruelty to his dog. The film is set in the 1970s and features a number of shocking scenes.\n",

Lt Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balances his devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to the force as an ace detective. \"Mr. Williams\" contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history. Ludicrously frocked, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines. Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb. \"The Amazing Mr. Williams\" is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct. While much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, at times it is both subtle and penetrating.\n",

Joan Blondell is as enjoyable as ever as his ever-suffering sweetheart. It doesn't quite reach classic status, but it has all the ingredients for a classic. The film is 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script, fine character actors, and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly don't notice that Williams (Douglas) isn't exactly Columbo.

NORMAN was the comedy of the month in whenever 1976 and everyone seemed to see it, laugh about it and then never ever mention it ever again. Famous for being shot. NORMAN is a raucous politically incorrect closet slamming farce that The Farrelly Brothers should look at remaking today.

      "I saw a trailer for this on Afro Promo, the collection of movie trailers for movies featuring African-Americans. It looked like what it is; a highly tendentious \"wacky\" comedy in which an uptight black man realizes that his son is gay. Norman tries to wake his lover, who steadfastly refuses to budge. Trying to buy time by making his elderly father take the stairs to what appears to be the 60th floor. Garson is a blue-eyed, swirl-hairdoed, white live-in lover. Norman orders his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit. Garson goes to stay with Waylon Flowers, and Madam answers the phone when Norman calls. RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico. While he is on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him. RF goes on a long walk, wherein he cycles through all of the thoughts a confused parent might have. His thoughts are all triggered by something he sees on his walk, for instance a burly truck driver appearing just as he is contemplating what makes a real man. RF then hires Audrey, a six-foot Amazon prostitute (in this amazing fur thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones. He hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but this pisses Norman and he storms out to go stay with his friend Melody. Then Garson comes over and offers to take RF out for the night. RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together. They attend a long featured performance of Wayon and Madam, which culminates in Madam violently bashing her head against the piano until her hair comes loose. Once more, mouths were agape. -effeminate entertainment of mega-queens in order to come around to ALL the gay world has to offer! It's really JUST that simple! This still does not prevent RF from yelling \"Rape!\" when Garson wakes him from a bad dream. RFK: I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends. RF: It's kind of just what it seems like: a little relic of a bygone era. The extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated, and provide a great deal of grist for discussion on how things have changed for gays in the past 30 years. I guess the only thing that seems offensive is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get them drunk. You can find the URL in my email address above. You can also find the address in the box at the bottom of the page. I hope to see you in the next issue of this blog.\n",

Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the prints from the theater can't have been great. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. The best scene in the movie is when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who's run away with his brother (!) to Ensenada in a souped up Pinto.

      "This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed. While late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest. At first, it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. After a while, it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama. especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first. Overall, it's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film. He was a \"starving artist\", homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI. He was a horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger! He was never a \"paper hanger\"\n",

      "This first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes, but there's no epilogue this time around. ARTET has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members, namely Naunton Wayne, Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer. While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor, it’s still done with the utmost care, acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. “The Verger” tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) who’s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest. Rather than rest on his laurels, despite his age, he not only takes a wife (his landlady, played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a stretch of road. The last scene, then, sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who, not only is surprised to learn of Hayter’s lack of education, but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were. The wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies, with some measure of irony, that he had the calling to be a verger! Nigel Patrick is British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most. During a fancy-dress party, the passengers decide to enact their ‘revenge’ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him. ’t appreciate)!; still, it’s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by Crawford that the necklace she’m wearing is an imitation, Wayne challenges Patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it's the genuine article. Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! The protagonist is a new intern, Roland Culver, who wistfully observes the various goings-on at the sanatorium. The narrative highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous, one melodramatic and one bittersweet. Simmons and Rennie are engaged. Simmons has been diagnosed as a ‘lifer’ by Dr. Morell. The couple are set to wed in the near future.\n",

This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre and was way before it's time. It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK.

      "The problem is that the movie rode in on the coattails of the 60's-created concept that comic books could only be done as \"camp\" Thus you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), a cluelessly unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable around women in the pulps, not an idiot) Monk Mayfair in a nightsheet is guaranteed to give you nightmares for several nights. Even as such, this movie is...okay. It's fun, and when it stays serious it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, who's hugely muscled, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a pale scrawny guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf. , for instance, are remarkably gruesome and not something I'd recommend for children. I think the problem is the movie's schizophrenic. There's a definite sense of trying to do a 30's homage, but they're also trying to give in to the \"heroes must be must be\" \" attitude that Batman created. One gets the impression there was a sober, pulp-style first draft. When the series actually gets on TV (allegedly mid-season in '99-00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90's, will live on.

I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I don't know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derring-do. Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has. Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people, the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right. The Sousa music is catchy. Very funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas. Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib. Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day.

      "Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based. I cannot comment, having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously. However, what I can say with certainty, is that it strikes me that many. of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass; Let's be honest here - this. film is just so much fun! Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a passing resemblance to Tarzan) film. The point is, yes this film is incredibly camp but that's precisely its charm! Best scene? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke, lemonade and milk at a formal occasion. Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines. The film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it. Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed!)\n",

      "It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression. It appears that the grim realities of a Nation caught up in the aftermath of this Economic Disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace. A temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is Baseball. The literature of the time also flourished at all levels. The juvenile reading habits helped to create the Comic Book as we know it. The Comic Book just did not magically appear, all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages, all by itself. The pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's ZORRO. The 1930's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8's BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER,MASTER of MEN all found their way to the news stands, among many others. The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40s. Doc was the prototype Super Hero. He assembled 5 of his former Army Buddies into a small, free lancing team of adventurers. , and were published into the middle '50's. Then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years. Then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new \"container\", the paperback book. \"Man of Bronze\" was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together. It was veteran Stop-action Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers. , Pamela Hensley in the female lead and veteran character Paul Wexler (as the villainous, Captain Seas); no other name would have been recognized. Use of narration, by Paul Frees, and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along. Some really great looking early scenes involving Doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the Paul Frees narration. The whole story unfolds like that, hitting the viewer with a little 'Camp' every so often, as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in the Hospital, just having given birth to our 2nd child, Michelle(08/14/75). Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her Grandmother. After visiting hours were over in the Maternity Ward, it was straight over to the old Marquette Theatre, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago. \"I could accept a little of this 'Camp' business, but would not have objected if Mr.Pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to give it all more Pulp/Comic/Serial type excitement\" , as far as we can see, very much like those of a '30's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone. And maybe that's just what they were trying for with this DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.\n",

The flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon. I only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was. \"A Message from Charity\" is based on the short story it was based on. In the story, a 16-year-ld boy is suffering a fever from unclean water. He is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever. Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985. Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment. The two try to learn a way to save Charity. Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lesson/warning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would've cooked up and entertainment. Probably 3/4 of this has no theme, but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterling's crew.\n",

      "Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums, his good will towards his fellow man backfires. Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. He's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV. Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman's massive talent as an actor. He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) to slow down and do some manual labor in life. ) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans. The movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives. This message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion. Jim Carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together. If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura, it's amazing how far he's come. He has moved from an entity overseeing the universe to a janitor dressed all in white. Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today. Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie as Bruce's girlfriend. Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better. There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning. It was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura's friend Spike make a cameo appearance. The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more. The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film. I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers. The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes. Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position. Jimmy Hoffa scene was buried with original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records. Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. I loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie, it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Don't miss this one.\n",

      "Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck. Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. The movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Bruce (Anniston) lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace, but the relationship is on shaky ground. Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired. Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his. he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building. There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect, but there are some entertaining moments. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done. , but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging. While far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.\n",

If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie. This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans. Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God's powers by making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston)'s breasts bigger and getting himself promoted. The film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor.

      "Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news. He is desperate to prove himself (more or less TO himself) that he can be taken seriously. This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace. ) away. When the final straws are executed, he's quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he's guilted into helping others. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground. Carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. The movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected. ' anywhere in the world' is a popular phrase. The phrase is used to refer to places in the U.S. and around the world. It can also be translated as 'anywhere in this world' or 'in this country'\n",

      "\"Bruce Almighty\" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs. The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking. The message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and \"be the miracle\" The film is \"far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film,\" says director Tom Hanks. The film is based on the novel by the same name. The book was published by Simon & Schuster, which also published the film.\n",

I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the past three years. The bottom line: this a purely entertaining film, each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do, and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion. Without Married With Children t o complain about, this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and late nigh television, selling prayers to God).

      "David Mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with `House of Games' A psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel. The film stars Joe Mantegna as a con-man who tricks his way into a woman's heart. She decides to intervene on his behalf, and he agrees to wipe the slate clean. The dialogue, and Mamet's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing. As Mike leads Margaret through his compelling, surreal realm of existence, and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game, we are swept right along with her. In the end, Margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature, and about herself. Mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film. Crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here. The dynamic supporting cast includes Mike Nussbaum (Joey), Lilia Skala (Dr. Littauer), J.T. Walsh (The Businessman), Ricky Jay (George) and William H. Macy (Sergeant Moran). `House of Games' is the quintessential Mamet; he makes you believe that she is capable of what she does, and makes you understand it, as well. \"This is one great movie you do not want to miss,\" says Tom Charity. \"I rate this one 10/10,\" he adds. \"This film will be the one that defines him,\" says Charity.\n",

      "House of Games is the directional debut from playwright David Mamet. It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide. The psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film fan is the constant guessing of who is in control. In House of Games the direction is dull and most of the times flat and uninspiring. However in every David Mamet film it is the story which is central to the whole proceedings, not the direction. The dialogue grips you and slowly draws you into the film. House of Games can also be viewed as a `class-war' division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle-class, well-to-do educated psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the complete opposite, the working class of America earning a living by `honest' crime. The film seduces the viewer much like Crouse is seduced by MantEGna and the end result is ultimately a ultimately a 'class war' movie. An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings. satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the film is definitely something for all to see and watch out for, it's stunning.\n",

      "House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels. It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller. Its dialogue, written by David Mamet, is spoken as if in a play of manners and gives the movie an extra dimension of unrealness. At this level it does succeed admirably. You cannot escape the examination at a deeper level of the odyssey of a woman from complacent professional competence to incredible strength and self realization. The only movie I know of which treats the theme of emergence of personal strength in a woman in as worthy a way is the underrated Private Benjamin. House of Games sticks to its business. after some easy laughs. As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater. It should be a natural for film festivals. Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance. I bought the original version of House of Games and gave it to my 23-year-old daughter. Better she should see it on a TV than not at all. I'm a bit of a Game of Thrones fan.\n",

      "The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie. It's like \"The Grifters,\" but without that film's level of acting. The acting here is very flat. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up. The film doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre. In that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. It's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. It's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. That doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. She walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt. I'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want Mamet, go watch \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" again -- James Foley did him better.\n",

      "House of Games is spell binding. It's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens. There are few movies I've seen that can grip you so quickly. From the opening scene this movie just gets you. Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection, from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately. The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved the way the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal type of way, it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I've seen on the big screen. The buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying. You know something's going to happen but you have no idea what. House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature. As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters, we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it. When it comes to movies of the human psyche, it really doesn't get much better then this. It contains some of the best \"twists\" I've ever seen as well. Not my absolute favorite film, pretty high on the list.\n",

      "'House of Games' may very well be the best con movie I've seen. David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that's full of snappy dialogue, great one-liners, and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end. The film is in utter control of it's audience; and we are loving the con. Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change. Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man.\n",

      "\"House Of Games\" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. But that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game. The film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort \"Marnie\", considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the Master's more thought-provoking works. One could easily consider the idea of Lindsay Crouse's character being the same as Tippi Hedrin's. Both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. Put your Reality Check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks. Up-tight character says, \"What's life without adventure?\" Put your reality check on a high setting and go swimming.\n",

      "This film is extremely well written, and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit, con-artistry and back room hustles. The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting ( 1973) and it also pays homage to film noir. Lindsay Crouse is outstanding in the role of a gambler, a smoker and a thief. It is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. The less you know about the shady characters, the more interesting the film is. Just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance.

The film cons the audience on many occasions, and despite us knowing this; it's still difficult to guess where it's going. Every twist comes off as a surprise. House of Games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout, and David Mamet does well in establishing his film's setting in the underground levels of the city. The film is well acted, with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill. The way that the film executes it's plot is the main star of the show. You will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer. At times it's almost like we are in the film. The film shows the audience how to pull off certain cons, which is useful if you're interested in making twenty bucks, say. All in all, House of Games is a truly first rate thrill ride.\n",

      "\"House of Games\" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films I have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends. I first saw it on video a few years back after reading Roger Ebert's review. Mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. It stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. Mantegna and Crouse's work, plus Mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's.\n",

They beat her, put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood, spin her around on a chair until she pukes, expose her to loud noise, pour boiling oil on her and put worms in her sores. Finally pokes a needle through her eye. Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it. It scared me. I guess it fills some kind of purpose.

      "\"Guinea Pig\" is the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. Girl gets tortured for '45 min, without any reasons given. Fingernails teared off, beaten with hands, feet, tools, infested by maggots. I saw it in japonese without subtitles, but it's not a problem ( no real dialogues, the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). I haven't seen yet all the serial, but the first \"Guinea Pig\" is not known for being the best one. Still I've rated 8, because if the purpose was making people believe this, it's OK. The film is quite good, but I think they could have gone further, which they did in the following ones. I'm hiding from my parents. I think the movie is good. But I think it could have been better.\n",

I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to watch the collection in order by release date. From what I had read on the internet, I was expecting to test my nerves in full force. This ended up not being the case. The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and begin torturing her with the hopes of discovering the human breaking point. The film fails to shock. This may be because I have become desensitized over the years do to my obsession with horror. Any true gorehound could sit through this with ease. The film contains some pretty mean spirited and graphic scenes of violence. The ripping out of fingernails, intestines thrown at an unconscious woman, and a needle through the eye are just some of the scenes.\n",

Charlie Sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one, so my interest was peaked. A lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes. But then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. The scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. The worst is the eye scene.

      "This movie has to be my favorite of all time. Its not supposed to have a plot, because its makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think)to believe it was a real snuff film. There is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film. The movie \"Baise Moi\" has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything. The rape scene was funny instead of shocking. Although i'm sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror. Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want no frills real footage (accident & crime scenes/footage). Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film. The PS3 has better graphics than the PS2. The PS3 is better because it has a better graphics chip. It's better because the chip is better than the chip that was used in the PS3.\n",

      "I saw this when it first came to video, my little sister got it as a gift and I was probably 12 at the time... What stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have. This is what I like the most about the movie I guess, that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through. They don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal. These two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track, they're not that different. Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family. Cecelia was an upper class kid who just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone. Little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with Dr. Screweyes. analyze the script and no, Woog and Dweeb shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores. \"It's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think\" \"It just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie, so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half\"\n",

I will admit though that the story is on the thin side. The animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells Screweyes \"I quit!\" had me in stitches. The script, while not Oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith all gave solid performances. This is a good movie. Sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as Land Before Time, but it is good fun. as Screweyes and almost unrecognisable. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox\n",

The band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a deft, comical manner. No, you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window. Lord Foxley said \"oh yes!\" to get more money for breakage. Jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people. All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some great laughs. The film is a must-see for any movie-lovers. It's a great example of the film industry's ability to make a profit from its films. The film was released in the U.S. on September 14.\n",

      "Widowed and thus broke, Grace is a master gardener, and is enlisted to help her friend/employee Matthew grow his pot plant. \"Saving Grace\" seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other British comedies over the past two years. Highlight is Grace travelling to London to deal some of her merchandise, dressed in what looks like the white suit John Travolta wore in \"Saturday Night Fever\" and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, who I liked in \"La Femme Nikita\", is memorable.

      "A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie, and it was a who's who of the top Canadian bands of the age. We got there about 4am, waited in line most of the morning, and when the doors opened at 9am, we were among the first inside the gates. Desmond Howl had it all. It's hard to say what he's lost, since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains. So, in my hatred of the band, I have denied myself the delight that is Whale Music. Canadian cinema suffers from several problems. A lack of money, as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help leads to lower production values than American or British films. Most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like, well, not like an American film. , Canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story. Third, they seem to think that gratuitous nudity (often full-frontal) makes something artistic. It's almost like a \"don't do this\" handbook exists out there somewhere and Canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago. Whale Music is such a film, on the surface. Deeper than just its Canadian-isms, it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip, through grief and excess, who is redeemed by music then by love.\n",

It's about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies. What saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways, that the actors are as great as they are and don't overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the story. there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds. The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film. You know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background, but that's something you have to neglect.\n",

Yet, having read the content, I decided to spend my Christmas evening on watching the movie. The effect surprised me totally: I do not remember when I last saw a film in which every single moment involved me. The movie has something to offer to the modern audience - pure right faith and some answers for the universal questions. The movie provides the answers through the content since all that happens to the characters may as well happen to any of us. The main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard hard times. Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock)? Had John's rebellious brother, Phil (D. David Morin), better go on his easy life? Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterwork of universal aspect of humanity. These words could be as well said by everybody no matter of where, when or how they live. The movie is a great portrayal of family, not very popular nowadays. , it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one. The entire film focuses on people's mutual help. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such attitude. Isn't it possible that we may become angels to one another? Barbara Babcock gives an authentic performance as Ellen. Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband. The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park walking on the fallen leaves (autumn) A VOW TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that realistically showed to me what it means to love, what fidelity is. It once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe. At the end, I would like to quote the profound words from the movie I found very touching and hope you will also do.\n",

      "This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Say Anything\" deliver nice portrayals, this movies strips down useless subplots. This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this film, I don't think I will ever tire of that.\n",

      "Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it's glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day. Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. characters to be free, and it's easy to believe that these are real people. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they're the protagonists. , and although I'm not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. The city of Vienna isn't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beautiful of the location.\n",

These once in a lifetime friendships occur between people with long distances between and there are always some natural reasons for why we don't meet them anymore. 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching it. I didn't know what to expect from it, but nor did the young couple. They had time to discuss with each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to separate. I believe this film has had good reviews because the situation is something that everybody on this planet has at least once or twice lived through. People we have met only once in our lives. People we have never met before. people we've never met in our life. People who have never been to our house before. People with no connection to us. people who have met us only once.\n",

The movie could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer) High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and the director's team. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman. for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is.\n",

      "Before Sunrise is one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, maybe even in all of contemporary cinema. How does one fall in love at first sight? No one does, at least that's deep down the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. Linklater here gives us the story of Celine and Jessie, a French girl and an American boy who get off the same train heading to Vienna. Jessie persuades Celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town', in Vienna, until his plane the next morning. Jessie and Celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential, or seemingly so, and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loves, or what weren't really loves, of being part of a family. The film is never exactly cynical itself, just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives. It's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in these roles. The conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters. The film is not incessantly annoying in that 90s Generation-X mode, but are the kinds of people one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere. \"I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player\" \"We can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future\" It's a very dense film, and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly. One scene especially, which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone' in front of each other. Mimicking each other's expositions might go to the other's friend. A+ for the effort. A- for the humor. A + for the sense of fun. A plus for the creativity.\n",

      "The primary reason to see \"Before Sunrise,\" is to watch a young Julie Delpy deliver her lines. As \"Celine,\" this sexy, brainy, soulful brown-eyed blond is sort of a cross between Brigitte Bardot and Joni Mitchell. Ethan Hawke as \"Jessie\" comes off like a vaguely appealing slob, sort of a Maynard G. Krebs of the nineties. that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak, for her sincere, intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating. His pants fit poorly, his tee shirt is coming untucked, and his wavy dark hair (his most attractive feature) needs a good washing. Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe. His oft-cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic Celine. After blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes, bars, and silly diversions, they agree that because they may never see one another again, they should make the most of it. Jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night. Jesse, as the very definition of a naive jerk, foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp. He contents himself with a half-baked plan to reunite at the same spot in half a year. When the appointed time comes, you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another. Despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion, \"Before Sunrise\" is a beautiful movie. I highly recommend both it and the sequel, 'Before Sunset' \"Before Sunset\" is out now on Blu-ray.\n",

If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end, don't waste your time and money. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters. The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power. The dialog is fascinating. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive.

      "Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors, Ethan Hawke (Reality Bites, Dead Poets Society), only 25 at the time of the film's release. After sleeping it over, I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter, and I shall explain why. The film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting. He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris. The characters of Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies, were a mirror of the time. Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well is what really made this movie.  Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna. The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.\n",

The ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in Vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. The actors acted in a very good manner, so, that, I began to believe that I, myself could live a love story just like this.\n",

      "I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago. Having saw it twice, I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise, not because the sequel was not as great, but I felt that these two movies completed each other. Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it. When I saw it for the first time, about 8 year ago when I was 20, I already liked it. Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic, it was 10 minutes too long. \"I saw the elements more clearly: Jesse, Celine, Vienna, their conversations, everything. How each of them are separated element by itself, and they have a chance to mix\" \"I am no longer feel manipulated. And the freedom that every scene has, as well as its refusal to be overly efficient\" Before Sunrise is one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time, not a destination, every single scene has its own life. The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that, maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case. One of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other. Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes, seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine. Meanwhile, I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset. Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts, and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it. takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me, no matter how beautiful Paris is. I'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English.\n",

Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships. Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it.

What counts is the number of people responding to the film. MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $2.00 or less.

      "Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso. But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film. Mario Lanza started recording right around the turn of the last century. Together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became. When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live. Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso. Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, and Jarmila Novotna also. If you're looking for a life of Enrico Caruso, this ain't it. If you areLooking for a great artist singing at the height of his career, than you should not miss The Great Carusi.\n",

      "Mario Lanza, of course, is \"The Great Caruso\" in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today. xtet from \"Lucia\" will strike you as odd - even if Caruso's wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. Also it's highly unlikely that CarUSo ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him. He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake. MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha. He had a hemorrhage during \"L'Elisir d'amore\" The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film. His last role was Eleazar in La Juive. Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy. Caruso and Dorothy did have a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). ings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza's voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music.

      "No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Sabu as the boy thief, Abu, John Justin as the dreamily in love deposed. The best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. , Ahmad and June Duprez as the lovely princess sought by Ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, Jaffar. The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram. Their adventures through the gaily decorated Hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work. Duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. Justin's Ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. Sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. \"Thief of Bagdad\" is a pre-war Hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted. Still, I don't think anyone under eight ought to see \"Thief\" 9.9/10. enduringly attractive and important releases. This is one of the best of its kind. It is a great album. It was a great release.

The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds, attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror. For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before, while through its use of color, it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before. The 1940 version remains the screen's finest fairy tale. \"The Thief of Bagdad\" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights.

Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also measures up to any of today's teen actors in appeal. In 1940, the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects. Today, those effects seem very dated. Yet they fit into the story well. The Thief of Bagdad remained state-of-the-art for the next twenty-five years.

Evil Vizier Jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne. After escaping with a little thief played by Sabu, Ahmad spots a Princess and they fall blindingly in love.

      "The movie tells the tale of a prince whose life is wonderful, but after an evil wizard tells him to go into town disguised as a beggar the wizard then locks up the prince. The jailed prince meets a thief called Abu who helps him escape the jail and head to a town called Basra where he meets a princess who he falls madly in love with. This is a pure fantasy movie from start to finish it has flying horses, genies, flying carpets, and wizards that can actually do something. The prince and Abu go off on an adventure to find a way to defeat Jafa, restore peace to Baghdad and marry the princess. It doesn't have any cheesy moments and the love story isn't a waste of time. The music and songs are also well done. Anyone who sees it will no doubt hail, \"I want to be a sailor sailing on the seas\" as one of the great musical moments in movies. What sells the movie for me is the sheer fact that you get to see things you don't see in everyday life. Way before today's modern fantasy movie came along with their realistic CGI to blow our minds there was this movie which blew your mind without having green screen scattered all over the place. The main appeal of that shot for me was seeing these great fantasy beings doing what is essentially manual labor. That's what I love about the Genie and other creatures in the movie. They're just there trying to make a living just like everyone else. I first saw this as a kid in the motherland and thought it was the greatest thing in the world and upon watching it again last week I still think it's amazing. Sure, the effects look a wee bit outdated and cheesy but it was made way back in the 40's so give it a break. If you ever wanted to see a live action version of \"Aladdin\" then you should get your wish with this. The angry cynical bunch will probably do good in avoiding this since this won't be their cup of tea.\n",

      "\"The Thief of Bagdad\" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points. Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. Then he is captured. When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself, Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog. , accompanied by Abu as his dog. The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. He does awaken her. She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad, but she is captured by JAffar who then throws the dog overboard. Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. For freeing him, he gets three wishes. His first is for sausages. Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. He has the genie take him to Ahmad. Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. Abu finds himself in the \"Land of Legend\", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess. He arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet. This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda. wed his Princess; but when he tries to make Abu his vizier, the young thief refuses. What he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace. Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris. Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan. As Ahmad, John Justin appears to do most of what can be done. This film has a spaciousness about it that is found, I assert, in other Korda works also. Its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. This is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time.\n",

      "Lavish escapist fare from the legends of The Arabian Nights. Replete with swords & sorcery, it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines. Conrad Veidt gets top billing and he deserves it, playing the lead. As the boyish Thief, Sabu is perfectly cast in this, his third film. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is certainly heroic in deed & action. The rest of the cast do fine work. when he's not transformed into a dog) but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs must. Miles Malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike Sultan of Basra, forever dithering on about his mechanical toys. Aged Morton Selten portrays the older Sultan. June Duprez plays the endangered Princess ofBasra, coveted by two very different men. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual roles of Jaffar's accomplice and the six-armed Silver Dancer. Art direction, in vibrant Technicolor, is most attractive, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, whites & pinks. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films. Sabu died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age. His final movie, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late.\n",

      "This film, was one of my childhood favorites and I must say that, unlike some other films I liked in that period The Thief of Bagdad has held on to it's quality while I grew up. This is not merely a film to be enjoyed by children, it can be watched and enjoyed by adults as well. The only drawback there is, is that one can not see past the 'bad' effects (compared to the effects nowadays) like one could when one was a child. In my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one, which creates a wonderful mixture. Although the film is old and the music and style of the films is clearly not modern, it succeeds in not being dusty and old. Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, providing the comedic and the chilling elements of the film for the most part. I hope someone has the brain and guts to release this one on DVD someday.\n",

      "This is an Oriental fantasy about ¨thousand and one Arabian nights¨ plenty of incredible adventures, fantasy witchery and wizardly. The malignant vizier Jaffar (magnificently played by Conrad Veidt) imprisons the prince Ahamad of Bagdad. This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time. Story accumulates several fantastic ingredients such as transformation of the starring, a flying mechanic horse, magic bow, flying carpet and of course the colossal genie. The splendid visual and glimmer Technicolor cinematography , setting and FX provoked the achieving three Oscars. The WWII outbreak caused the paralyzing shooting, then the three Korda brothers and collaborators traveled USA continuing there the filming in especial on Grand Cannon Colorado. This vivid tale with immense doses of imagination will like to fantasy fans and cinema classic buffs. The evocative and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa is one of the film's highlights.\n",

Now that I'm grown up and have a kid of my own, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it last Friday, and he liked it. aschid might as well be Oz under Ozma. My son especially liked how much of the heroics and derring-do were perpetrated by the boy-thief. In fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, \"Why does Ahmad love the Princess? Because the narrative demands it.\" The willingness of Abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love-struck deposed king is equally improbable. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous. CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

      "The making of The Thief Of Bagdad is quite a story unto itself, almost as wondrous as the tale told in this film. Alexander Korda had conceived this film as early as 1933 and spent years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately caught up with him and the mounting expenses of filming a grand spectacle. Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those sequences with Rex Ingram as the genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly wasn't going to get scenery like that in the UK. Korda also finished the interiors in Hollywood, all in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940. , best art&set direction for a color film, and best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take home a prize in a nominated category. The good is the two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez and the evil is Conrad Veidt as the sorcerer. . This was Veidt's career role until Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. Sabu captures all the innocence and mischievousness of youth as a beggar boy and thief. The Thief Of Bagdad holds up remarkably well today. It's an eternal tale of love, romance, and adventure in any order you want to put it. Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.\n",

      "The film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out, pushing it to six. For John Kobal's 1987 book, \"The Top 100 Movies\", his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movie's production shifted around England and America, eventually seeing completion in 1940. Among them is an amusing horse, constructed out of a kit model, which, when a key is inserted up it's rear end, begins to fly. Most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as, in a superb moment of cinematic conceit, a djinn (genie) nearly a thousand feet tall. Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature, and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. Sabu, the astonishingly muscled 15year-old, is near-namesake Abu, a likeably cocky thief. After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog. Three small songs pepper the piece, though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient. Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads, Veidt is the boo-hiss villain, and Abu is the irrepressible robber. The film really draws you in. once you've sat through the first half of the hour or so. Quite commendable. The film is very well made and the performances are top notch.\n",

This probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together. The scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider. 8/10. probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time.\n",

Periodically, I check here at IMDb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a DVD. It's September of 2004, and I keep hoping. Short-lived PBS series showcased original screenplays by new and up-and-coming playwrights. I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. My understanding is that the DVDs are burned from the writer's own personal copy.\n",
